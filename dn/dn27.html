<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">

<p id="dn27:1.1"><span class="parno">dn27:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta is the closest we come to a Buddhist myth of origins. It draws on features of Vedic mythology, while giving its own spin. Related stories may be found in <a href="../dn/dn26.html#content">DN26</a> and <a href="../snp/snp2.7.html#content">Snp2.7</a>. The Buddha describes a natural process of evolution that requires no metaphysical intervention, yet differs strikingly from Darwinian evolution in prioritizing the role of desire over selection.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn27:1.3"><span class="parno">dn27:1.3</span>Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">We met Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja as the students of Pokkharasāti and Tārukkha respectively in <a href="../dn/dn13.html#content">DN13</a>, at the end of which they went for refuge. Some time later they must have asked for ordination. The commentary says that probation (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paravasati</i>) was required, not because they had previously gone forth in other sects  (as the naked ascetic Kassapa at <a href="../dn/dn8.html#dn8:23.5">DN8:24.1</a> or the wanderer Subhadda at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:5.28.1">DN16:5.29.1</a>), nor because they had committed an offence, but because they were not yet the required twenty years of age.</span></span></span> Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:2.1"><span class="parno">dn27:2.1</span>Vāseṭṭha saw him<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here as in <a href="../dn/dn13.html#content">DN13</a> Vāseṭṭha takes the lead.</span></span></span> and said to Bhāradvāja, “Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse. Come, reverend, let’s go to the Buddha. Hopefully we’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:2.6"><span class="parno">dn27:2.6</span>“Yes, reverend,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>



<p id="dn27:2.7"><span class="parno">dn27:2.7</span>So they went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him. </p>



<p id="dn27:3.1"><span class="parno">dn27:3.1</span>Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “Vāseṭṭha, you are both brahmins by birth and family, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don’t have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins.” </p>



<p id="dn27:3.3"><span class="parno">dn27:3.3</span>“Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:3.4"><span class="parno">dn27:3.4</span>“But how do the brahmins insult you?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:3.5"><span class="parno">dn27:3.5</span>“Sir, the brahmins say: ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This verse is also at <a href="../mn/mn84.html#highestcaste">MN84</a> and <a href="../mn/mn93.html#">MN93</a>. <br> For “best class” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">seṭṭho vaṇṇo</i>) see <i lang="pi" translate="no">varṇaśreṣṭhaḥ</i> at Mahābhārata 1.24.4c.</span></span></span> Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mahābhārata 12.181.5 says that brahmins are the white class, aristocrats red, peasants yellow, and menials black. Underlying this is an assumption of the superiority of the fair-skinned northerners of Indo-Aryan descent over the dark-skinned natives (see <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.9.4">DN3:1.10.1</a>).</span></span></span> Only brahmins are purified, not others.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I cannot trace this statement to Brahmanical texts, and indeed they have a strong tendency to push back against the idea that only brahmins can find purity.</span></span></span> Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity. You’ve both abandoned the best class to join an inferior class, namely these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An allusion to the famous Puruṣasūkta (Rig Veda 10.90.12): “His (the cosmic Man’s) mouth became the brahmin, his arms became the ruler (<i lang="pi" translate="no">rājanya</i>, an alternate name for the <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiyas</i>), his thighs became the peasant (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vaiśya</i>); the menial (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sūdra</i>) was born from his feet.” This belongs to the latest portion of the Rig Veda, and probably represents a time when the system of four castes was established in the late Vedic period, some centuries before the Buddha. Apart from this, the Rig Veda hardly mentions any of these as castes, let alone all four together.</span></span></span> This is not right, it’s not proper!’ That’s how the brahmins insult us.” </p>



<p id="dn27:4.1"><span class="parno">dn27:4.1</span>“Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to you. For brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha gives a rationalist critique of Vedic myth (see also <a href="../mn/mn93.html#superior">MN93</a>), the fairness of which is not easy to assess. Within the Brahmanical world, especially the progressive Kosalan brahmins to whom Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja belonged, there had been a shift towards a more nuanced symbolic understanding of such claims. Yet the subtle distinctions of the philosophers rarely influence the more straightforward beliefs of the common practitioner.</span></span></span> Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say: ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others. Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’ They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and brim with much wickedness. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. Purification in the Four Classes </h3>



<p id="dn27:5.1"><span class="parno">dn27:5.1</span>Vāseṭṭha, there are these four classes: aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials. Some aristocrats kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Dark” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇha</i>) and “bright” (or “light”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">sukka</i>) are redefined in ethical not racial terms.</span></span></span> And they are also seen among some brahmins, peasants, and menials. </p>



<p id="dn27:6.1"><span class="parno">dn27:6.1</span>But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view. These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are exhibited in some aristocrats. And they are also seen among some brahmins, peasants, and menials. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:7.1"><span class="parno">dn27:7.1</span>Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four classes—the dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say: ‘Only brahmins are the best class; other classes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light class; other classes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others. Only brahmins are the Divinity’s true-born sons, born from his mouth, born of the Divinity, created by the Divinity, heirs of the Divinity.’ </p>



<p id="dn27:7.6"><span class="parno">dn27:7.6</span>Sensible people don’t acknowledge this. Why is that? Because any mendicant from these four classes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not against principle.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vedic theory claimed that the caste system was part of the order of nature (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i>) established by Brahmā, and hence to follow the obligations of caste was a duty (also <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i>). The Buddha posited a higher “principle” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i>) beyond caste. The English word “principle” carries the senses of a fundamental law; a code of conduct; a devotion to right living; a source; and an underlying faculty, all of which are aspects of <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i> in this passage.</span></span></span> For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the best thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:7.10"><span class="parno">dn27:7.10</span>And here’s a way to understand how this is so. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn27:8.1"><span class="parno">dn27:8.1</span>King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans. And the Sakyans are his vassals.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A great king such as Pasenadi ruled his central realm, while outlying districts pledged allegiance to him, enjoying royal protection while ceding some sovereignty. It is the same relationship described for the kingdoms subsumed under the Wheel-Turning Monarch (eg. <a href="../dn/dn17.html#1.9.5">DN17:1.9.5</a>). The Buddha described his people as natives among the Kosalans at <a href="../snp/snp3.1.html#">Snp3.1</a>.</span></span></span> The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One. But he doesn’t think: ‘The ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Mahāsaṅgīti reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">na naṁ</i> yields a better sense than the PTS <i lang="pi" translate="no">nanu</i>, which would make this a question.</span></span></span> He is powerful, I am weak. He is handsome, I am ugly. He is illustrious, I am insignificant.’ Rather, in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring, respecting, and venerating principle. </p>

<p>And here’s another way to understand how principle is the best thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>


<hr><a id="selfluminous"></a>

<p id="dn27:9.1"><span class="parno">dn27:9.1</span>Vāseṭṭha, you have different births, names, clans, and families, yet have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vāseṭṭha was said to be a high family, while Bhāradvāja was low (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc2.html#content">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 2</a>).</span></span></span> When they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics who follow the Sakyan. But only when someone has faith in the Realized One—settled, rooted, and planted deep, strong, not to be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world—is it appropriate for them to say: ‘I am the Buddha’s true-born son, born from his mouth, born of principle, created by principle, heir to principle.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha adapts the Brahmanical rhetoric of birth from the “mouth of Brahmā”. Having criticized them for taking this literally he employs it in a metaphorical sense.</span></span></span> Why is that? For these are terms for the Realized One: ‘the embodiment of principle’, and ‘the embodiment of divinity’, and ‘the manifestation of principle’, and ‘the manifestation of divinity’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“The embodiment of principle” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhammakāya</i>. This is a term of unique occurrence in the suttas, which was seized on in later days to posit a metaphysical theory of a quasi-eternal Buddha. In the suttas, it means that he, having practiced the Dhamma to its fullest, embodies the qualities of the Dhamma to the highest degree.</span></span></span> </p>



<p id="dn27:10.1"><span class="parno">dn27:10.1</span>There comes a time when, Vāseṭṭha, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here begins the story of origins. The Buddha begins his creation myth with the end of the world. For this passage, compare <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn:2.1.1">DN2:2.2.1</a>.</span></span></span> As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>



<p id="dn27:10.4"><span class="parno">dn27:10.4</span>There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. As the cosmos expands, sentient beings mostly pass away from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the Brahmajālasutta, beings pass from one Brahmā realm to another, but when they come to this world it is as a human. Here we have a different perspective, where beings apparently still like the Brahmā gods exist in the physical realm.</span></span></span> Here they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, wandering in midair, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The role of food is critical throughout this narrative. Food is a fundamental sustenance on which all creatures must rely, and the nature of the food reflects the type of creature that eats it. Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.5.1 says the highest form of self is made of bliss (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ātmā ānandamaya</i>).</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Earth’s Nectar Appears </h3>



<p id="dn27:11.1"><span class="parno">dn27:11.1</span>But the single mass of water at that time was utterly dark.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Creation myths often begin with a dark, formless world of water, and describe the emergence of divisions and structures of the world. They do not differentiate the physical, biological, ecological, or social, as such distinctions came later. <br> Aitareya Upaniṣad 1.3.3 says the Divinity “brooded over the waters” and created food.</span></span></span> The moon and sun were not found, nor were stars and constellations, day and night, months and fortnights, years and seasons, or male and female. Beings were simply known as ‘beings’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Throughout, the discourse has a special interest in tracing the origins of language and how different usages came about. Here the term “beings” is presented as a natural choice: they are “beings” because they are alive. Later, words are selected to convey a certain political or moral stance.</span></span></span> After a very long period had passed, the earth’s nectar curdled in the water.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The reading and sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">samatani</i> is obscure. I think it is connected with <i lang="pi" translate="no">santānaka</i> in the next line, in the sense of “networks” or tendrils appearing in the water as it curdles. The Sanskrit at SF 277 and Mūlasarvāstvāda Vinaya 17 has <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁmūrcchitaḥ saṁtanoti</i> (“curdled tendrils”). <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Rasapathavī</i> (“earth’s nectar”) is also obscure.

In <a href="../dn/dn13.html#dn13:13.1">DN13:13.1</a> the Buddha told Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja the Vedas were recited by people who did not understand them.

And what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the evening, leaving no trace showing.

Get lost, filth!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Nassa</i> could mean “die!” or “get lost”. I take the softer meaning, as killing has not yet appeared among these beings. <br> This behavior looks much like scapegoating rituals, where certain members of the community are deemed to bear the sins of all and are sacrificed to erase the sin.

<hr>

<p id="dn27:21.1"><span class="parno">dn27:21.1</span>‘Elected by the populace’, Vāseṭṭha, is the meaning of ‘popularly elected’, the first term applied to them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note that “popularly elected” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahāsammata</i>) is not a name but a term describing their position. The passage suggests that the prefix <i lang="pi" translate="no">mahā</i> does not mean that the elected one is “great”, but that they were elected by the “populace” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahājana</i>). <br> “Applied to them” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">upanibbattaṁ</i>) is unique. The Sanskrit texts have <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁjñodapādi</i>, “arisen by agreement”. It is distinct from <a href="#dn27:10.4">DN27:11.1</a> above, where beings “come to be called” beings (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhyaṁ gacchanti</i>). Clearly it cannot mean the first word that appeared. I take it to mean this was a specialized term invented and applied just for them.

<p id="dn27:21.2"><span class="parno">dn27:21.2</span>‘Lord of the fields’ is the meaning of ‘aristocrat’, the second term applied to them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Aristocrat” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i>; Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṣatriya</i>) is related to <i lang="pi" translate="no">khatta</i> (“authority”, “power”; in eg. Rig Veda 8.25.8 it is an adjective, “powerful”), hence “ruling class”. The sutta, however, relates it to <i lang="pi" translate="no">khetta</i>, “field”. The two senses possibly stem from the same root <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṣi</i> in the sense “owner”, “master” with the “field” being the dominion owned by the chief. In Pali suttas, the primary connotation of the <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i> was of an aristocratic land-owning class, so the connection with “field” is apt. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Khattiyas</i> are often said to be a “warrior” caste, but that is not a primary association in the suttas. They are rarely depicted as having anything to do with the military, which had become professionalized by the time of the Buddha. Nonetheless, at <a href="../mn/mn96.html#wealth">MN96</a> a <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya’s</i> wealth is said to be the bow and arrow.
