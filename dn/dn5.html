<h3>1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata </h3>

<p id="dn5:1.1"><span class="parno">dn5:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When asked about sacrifice, the Buddha tells a story of how a king was persuaded to forgo cruelty and institute a constructive social policy of welfare instead.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Khāṇumata is only mentioned here. It means “stumpy”, perhaps indicating that it was, or had recently been, a rough out-of-the-way place.</span></span></span> There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary says this was similar to the Ambalaṭṭhikā of <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn:1.2.1">DN1</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn5:1.4"><span class="parno">dn5:1.4</span>Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Like the town Khāṇumata, the brahmin Kūṭadanta appears only here. His name means “pointy teeth”, but there is no evidence that he was a vampire.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At <a href="../snp/snp2.7.html#sacrifice">Snp2.7</a>, the sacrifice of cows in particular was said to be the nadir of decline for brahmins. When similar sacrifices are described elsewhere in the canon, the number is five hundred rather than seven hundred (<a href="../sn/sn3.9.html#content">SN3.9</a>, <a href="../an/an7.47.html#content">AN7.47</a>).</span></span></span>
</p>



<p id="dn5:2.1"><span class="parno">dn5:2.1</span>The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard: </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:2.2"><span class="parno">dn5:2.2</span>“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>



<p id="dn5:2.8"><span class="parno">dn5:2.8</span>Then, exiting Khāṇumata, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā. </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn5:3.1"><span class="parno">dn5:3.1</span>Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā, and addressed his butler, “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?” </p>



<p id="dn5:3.5"><span class="parno">dn5:3.5</span>“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn5:4.1"><span class="parno">dn5:4.1</span>Then Kūṭadanta thought, “I’ve heard that the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">News of the Buddha had spread in Brahmanical circles. In <a href="../dn/dn3.html#content">DN3</a> we saw the Buddha use his rhetorical technique of adapting his teaching to reframe Brahmanical doctrines in order to establish a common ground. Here we see the downside to such techniques, as the details of the reframing have been lost.</span></span></span> I don’t know about that, but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">No such sacrifice has been identified in Brahmanical texts.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:4.7"><span class="parno">dn5:4.7</span>Then Kūṭadanta addressed his butler, “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:4.11"><span class="parno">dn5:4.11</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta </h3>



<p id="dn5:5.1"><span class="parno">dn5:5.1</span>Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata thinking to participate in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice. They heard that Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama. </p>

<p>They approached Kūṭadanta and said to him: “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:5.7"><span class="parno">dn5:5.7</span>“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” </p>



<p id="dn5:6.1"><span class="parno">dn5:6.1</span>“Please don’t! It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama. For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>



<p id="dn5:6.6"><span class="parno">dn5:6.6</span>You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>



<p id="dn5:6.9"><span class="parno">dn5:6.9</span>You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:6.10"><span class="parno">dn5:6.10</span>You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … </p>

<p id="dn5:6.14"><span class="parno">dn5:6.14</span>You teach the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:6.15"><span class="parno">dn5:6.15</span>You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. … </p>



<p id="dn5:6.17"><span class="parno">dn5:6.17</span>You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:6.18"><span class="parno">dn5:6.18</span>and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. … </p>



<p id="dn5:6.19"><span class="parno">dn5:6.19</span>You live in Khāṇumata, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. The Qualities of the Buddha </h3>



<p id="dn5:7.1"><span class="parno">dn5:7.1</span>When they had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins: </p>



<p id="dn5:7.2"><span class="parno">dn5:7.2</span>“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama, and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me. He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me; rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:7.7"><span class="parno">dn5:7.7</span>When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. … </p>

<p id="dn5:7.10"><span class="parno">dn5:7.10</span>Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. … </p>



<p id="dn5:7.11"><span class="parno">dn5:7.11</span>He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He has divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. … </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn5:7.36"><span class="parno">dn5:7.36</span>The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest, and should be honored and respected as such. For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me, rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. This is the extent of the worthy Gotama’s praise that I have memorized. But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of the worthy Gotama is limitless.” </p>



<p id="dn5:7.45"><span class="parno">dn5:7.45</span>When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “According to Kūṭadanta’s praises, if the worthy Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a knapsack.” </p>



<p id="dn5:7.47"><span class="parno">dn5:7.47</span>“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">4. The Story of King Mahāvijita’s Sacrifice </h3>



<p id="dn5:8.1"><span class="parno">dn5:8.1</span>Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>



<p id="dn5:9.1"><span class="parno">dn5:9.1</span>Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, “Worthy Gotama, I’ve heard that you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories. I don’t know about that, but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.” </p>

<p id="dn5:9.7"><span class="parno">dn5:9.7</span>“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kūṭadanta’s proposal that the Buddha advise him on the sacrifice of 700 animals is outrageous. Nonetheless, the Buddha responds politely since Kūṭadanta is being polite. While it is tempting to see the sacrifice of animals by supposedly virtuous priests as sheer hypocrisy, the fact of sacrifice remains one of the most widespread and mysterious of human religious practices. In an empathetic work that addresses this squarely, Roberto Calasso’s <em>Ardor</em> sees the vast complex of Vedic ritual and theory as making plain the fact of killing so that the guilt may be contained, in contrast with our modern culture of killing on an industrial scale while hiding it out of sight.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn5:9.8"><span class="parno">dn5:9.8</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Kūṭadanta replied. </p>

<p>The Buddha said this: “Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mahāvijita means “Great Dominion”. He seems to be only known from this story. The idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhūtapubbaṁ</i> (literally “so it was in the past”) introduces legendary narratives of usually dubious historicity, like the English idiom “once upon a time”.</span></span></span> Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the Pali, meaningful thoughts often occur to people when withdrawn in seclusion. This doesn’t necessary mean they were in formal meditation.</span></span></span> ‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The great sacrifices, especially the horse sacrifice, ensured royal authority. Their very scale and wastefulness showed off the wealth of the king.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:10.4"><span class="parno">dn5:10.4</span>Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“High priest” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>. He was a family chaplain advising and consecrating the royal family. The closeness of the relationship is shown by the fact that the royal family would take the lineage name of the <i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>.</span></span></span> ‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, “I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ </p>



<p id="dn5:11.1"><span class="parno">dn5:11.1</span>When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him: ‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Raiding of villages, towns, and cities has been seen, and infesting of highways.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Then, as today, government policy was driven by the perception of rising crime rate. This whole passage is one of the Buddha’s most important statements on public policy. It is expressed through storytelling, giving a good example of how myths were invoked—and subverted—as rationales for current policy.</span></span></span> But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Taxes” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">bali</i>. He would have had to press his people for the extra funds to hold the sacrifice.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn5:11.4"><span class="parno">dn5:11.4</span>Now the king might think, “I’ll eradicate this plague of savages by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this plague of savages.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Plague of savages” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dassukhīla</i>) is the only occurrence of Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">dasyu</i> in early Pali. The <i lang="pi" translate="no">dasyu</i> were inveterate foes of the Aryans in the Vedic period. Bereft of civilizing rites, scriptures, and observances, they were no children of Manu (Rig Veda 10.22.8). Their wiles (<i lang="pi" translate="no">māyā</i>) made them a potent threat (Rig Veda 4.16.9, 8.14.14, 10.73.5). Indra was invoked to ensure their destruction (Rig Veda <em>passim</em>; Atharva Veda 2.14.5, 4.32.3, 20.21.4, 20.37.5, 20.42.2). Legend has it that Agni and Soma first supported the <i lang="pi" translate="no">dasyu</i> before being won over by Indra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.13; see also 6.4.2.4). By the time of the Buddha the <i lang="pi" translate="no">dasyu</i> have vanished except as a legendary foe of the past. Where the Brahmanical texts advocate the pitiless destruction of the <i lang="pi" translate="no">dasyu</i>, the brahmin high priest in the Buddhist text advocates an inclusive policy of social welfare.</span></span></span> Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The priest knows that the king will respond better to a pragmatic argument than a moral one.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn5:11.7"><span class="parno">dn5:11.7</span>Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the plague of savages will be properly uprooted.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Effective social policy requires a forward-thinking plan, not just reacting to grievances.</span></span></span> So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in growing crops and raising cattle.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The king should spend his own resources to support his citizens in the various occupations.</span></span></span> Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade. Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service. Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the priest identifies a fundamental cause of social unrest and disorder.</span></span></span> The king’s revenues will be great.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The king spends out of pocket, but the economy flourishes, so tax revenues increase even though he has not raised taxes. This is the essence of Keynesian economic theory.</span></span></span> When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Khema</i> means a place of safety and sanctuary, where both humans and animals have no fear.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:11.14"><span class="parno">dn5:11.14</span>The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A good leader listens to advice.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn5:11.19"><span class="parno">dn5:11.19</span>Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: ‘I have eradicated the plague of savages. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great. Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open.

Elsewhere the context does not always decide between these two possibilities. Generally the idiom aims at inclusivity, as opposed to here where the king is consulting the rich and powerful, so I treat them as two separate groups, thus including the common folk.</span></span></span> “I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, good fellows; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>



<p id="dn5:12.3"><span class="parno">dn5:12.3</span>The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying: ‘May the king perform a sacrifice!

<h3 class="subheading">6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>



<p id="dn5:28.1"><span class="parno">dn5:28.1</span>When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, “Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">7. The Realization of the Fruit of Stream-Entry </h3>



<p id="dn5:29.1"><span class="parno">dn5:29.1</span>Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>



<p id="dn5:30.1"><span class="parno">dn5:30.1</span>Then Kūṭadanta saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, “Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>



<p id="dn5:30.4"><span class="parno">dn5:30.4</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Kūṭadanta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own sacrificial enclosure. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.” </p>



<p id="dn5:30.7"><span class="parno">dn5:30.7</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the sacrificial enclosure of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. </p>



<p id="dn5:30.8"><span class="parno">dn5:30.8</span>Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
