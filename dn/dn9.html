<h3>1. On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda </h3>

<p id="dn9:1.1"><span class="parno">dn9:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>



<p id="dn9:1.3"><span class="parno">dn9:1.3</span>Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for philosophical debates, hedged by pale-moon ebony trees.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Poṭṭhapāda appears only here; he was named for a month of the lunar calendar (August/September). <br> Mallikā was the chief queen of Pasenadi, and her hall is mentioned in a similar context at <a href="../mn/mn78.html#content">MN78</a>. The commentary explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there to “debate their beliefs” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samayaṁ pavadanti</i>). Evidently the monastery grounds had accommodation for many ascetics of different beliefs, but only “one hall” where they would gather for debate. We hear many times of such debates, but here we catch a glimpse of a place that was set up to facilitate them. For <i lang="pi" translate="no">-ācīra</i>, read in the sense of “boundary, hedge” (commentary: <i lang="pi" translate="no">timbarūrukkhapantiyā parikkhittattā</i>; cf. Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">prācīra</i>, “enclosure, hedge, fence, wall”).</span></span></span> Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. </p>



<p id="dn9:2.1"><span class="parno">dn9:2.1</span>Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to the commentary, when he approached the vicinity of the city gate, he decided to check the position of the sun and noticed that it was too early to enter. The commentary and sub-commentary explain that it only sounds like the Buddha was in doubt, for Buddhas deliberate before deciding on a course of action.</span></span></span> Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This can be understood as answering the criticism voiced in <a href="../dn/dn8.html#assembly">DN8</a>, that the Buddha was afraid to speak in an assembly.</span></span></span> So that’s what he did. </p>



<p id="dn9:3.1"><span class="parno">dn9:3.1</span>Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In contrast with the silence of the Buddha’s community at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#silence">DN2</a>.</span></span></span> talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that place. </p>



<p id="dn9:4.1"><span class="parno">dn9:4.1</span>Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and hushed his own assembly, “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. Here comes the ascetic Gotama. The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha encourages quiet for the sake of mental development; Poṭṭhapāda does it for the sake of reputation.</span></span></span> Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>



<p id="dn9:5.1"><span class="parno">dn9:5.1</span>Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda, who said to him, “Let the Blessed One come, sir!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Poṭṭhapāda’s address is almost overly deferential.</span></span></span> Welcome to the Blessed One, sir! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” </p>



<p id="dn9:5.7"><span class="parno">dn9:5.7</span>The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Always polite, the Buddha begins by showing an interest in them.</span></span></span></p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.1. On the Cessation of Perception </h4>



<p id="dn9:6.1"><span class="parno">dn9:6.1</span>When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, “Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now. It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. </p>



<p id="dn9:6.4"><span class="parno">dn9:6.4</span>Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and a discussion about the cessation of perception came up among them:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Abhisaññā</i> does not appear elsewhere. Here the prefix <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhi-</i> means not “higher”, but rather “about, concerning”. Compare <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhidhamma</i> at <a href="../mn/mn32.html#kathenti">MN32</a> <i lang="pi" translate="no">dve bhikkhū abhidhammakathaṁ kathenti</i> (“two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching”); also <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhivinaya</i> at <a href="../an/an3.140.html#abhivinaya">AN3.140</a>. The commentary here says <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhi-</i> is a mere particle, so it need not be translated.</span></span></span> ‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discussion appears to have been directly sparked by the difficult passage in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13. The sage Yājñavalkya, teaching his wife Maitreyī, says that the true Self is a sheer mass of “consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vijñāna</i>, Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>), which is “great, endless, infinite reality”. After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁjñā</i>, Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā</i>), a statement that bewilders even the wise Maitreyī. He explains that only in an apparent state of duality (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dvaitamiva</i>) do the separate functions of sense consciousness operate. When all is realized as the Self, how, he asks, can one know that owing to which all this is known? He is implicitly distinguishing between <i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāna</i> as “infinite” (= <i lang="pi" translate="no">vi-</i>) knowing and <i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā</i> as “constrained” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁ-</i>) knowing. Yājñavalkya says the separate Self emerges with these elements and vanishes with them (<i lang="pi" translate="no">etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya tānyevānu vinaśyati</i>), but he does not explain how or why this happens, which is the question the theorists here attempt to address.</span></span></span> </p>



<p id="dn9:6.6"><span class="parno">dn9:6.6</span>Some of them said: ‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here perception is not identified with the “person” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purisa</i>), but rather belongs to them (cf. <i lang="pi" translate="no">etaṁ mama</i>, “this is mine”). In the discussion to follow, the Buddha only directly addresses this theory, while the remainder are included by inference.</span></span></span> When they arise, you become percipient. When they cease, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>



<p id="dn9:6.11"><span class="parno">dn9:6.11</span>But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This idiom is also at <a href="../sn/sn47.19.html#nothowitis">SN47.19</a>.</span></span></span> Perception is a person’s self,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The self is defined as perception (<i lang="pi" translate="no">eso me attā</i>), one of the five aggregates. Compare the various theories of the self and perception at <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn1:2.38.3">DN1</a>.</span></span></span> which enters and departs. When it enters, you become percipient. When it departs, you become non-percipient.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Implying that at such times a person lacks a “self”. This is perhaps related to Yājñavalkya’s: “That man, when born, acquiring a body, is connected with ills (the bodily organs); and when he dies, departing, he discards those ills” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.8).</span></span></span> That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>



<p id="dn9:6.18"><span class="parno">dn9:6.18</span>But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows! There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary says these were devotees of <i lang="pi" translate="no">āthabbaṇa</i>, i.e the practices preserved in the Atharvaveda. This “fourth Veda” is mentioned only once by name in the early Pali (<a href="../snp/snp4.14.html#athabbana">Snp4.14</a>), where, as here, it is associated with the performance of magic and the casting of spells. The commentary fairly drips with contempt: “Allegedly, the Āthabbaṇa practitioners cast a spell, showing a creature’s head as if cut off, or their hand as if cut off, or as if dead. Then they show them back to normal; imagining so, they say, ‘From cessation they have arisen.’”</span></span></span> They insert and extract a person’s perception.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../dn/dn29.html#upakaddhati">DN29</a> for <i lang="pi" translate="no">upakaḍḍhati</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">apakaḍḍhati</i> in this sense.</span></span></span> When they insert it, you become percipient. When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>



<p id="dn9:6.25"><span class="parno">dn9:6.25</span>But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, good fellows! There are deities of great power and might. They insert and extract a person’s perception. When they insert it, you become percipient. When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>



<p id="dn9:6.32"><span class="parno">dn9:6.32</span>That reminded me of the Buddha: ‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so very skilled in such matters.’ The Buddha is skilled and well-versed concerning the cessation of perception.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pakataññū</i> is not elsewhere attested in the suttas, but it is found in the Vinaya, for example at <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc72.html#pakatannu">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 72</a>).</span></span></span> How does the cessation of perception happen?” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause </h4>



<p id="dn9:7.1"><span class="parno">dn9:7.1</span>“Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start. Why is that? Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason. With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha argues that, since it is possible to change the nature of one’s own mind through practice, such changes cannot be random.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn9:7.6"><span class="parno">dn9:7.6</span>And what is that training?” said the Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is is unusual if not unique to add “said the Buddha” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhagavā avoca</i>) in such a context. Normally, once a speaker starts, the text does not insert extra tags identifying the speaker without a reason, such as an interruption for a question.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn9:7.7"><span class="parno">dn9:7.7</span>“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sinhalese manuscripts, followed by PTS, include the paragraphs on the metaphor of the king’s security (<a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:40.1">DN2</a>) and on guarding the sense doors here.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn9:9.1"><span class="parno">dn9:9.1</span>Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. </p>




<p id="dn9:10.1"><span class="parno">dn9:10.1</span>Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. The sensual perception that they had previously ceases.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Progress through the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> is explained in terms of the refining of perceptions.</span></span></span> At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Subtle and true” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">sukhumasacca</i>, a term that appears only here.</span></span></span> That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn9:11.1"><span class="parno">dn9:11.1</span>“Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn9:12.1"><span class="parno">dn9:12.1</span>“Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of bliss with equanimity. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn9:13.1"><span class="parno">dn9:13.1</span>“Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. The subtle and true perception of bliss with equanimity that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn9:14.1"><span class="parno">dn9:14.1</span>“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">We have encountered the “formless attainments” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">arūpasamāpatti</i>) before, where they formed a refined basis for attachment to self (<a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn:3.9.1">DN1</a>).

It is formed, made up of the four principal states, and consumes edible food. What is reincarnation in a mind-made life-form? It is formed, mind-made, whole in its major and minor limbs, not deficient in any faculty. What is reincarnation in a formless life-form? It is formless, made of perception. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn9:40.1"><span class="parno">dn9:40.1</span>I teach the Dhamma for the giving up of reincarnation in these three kinds of life-form. ‘When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.’ Poṭṭhapāda, you might think: ‘Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. But such a life is suffering.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare with the similar sentiment at <a href="../sn/sn22.2.html#suffering">SN22.2</a>.</span></span></span> But you should not see it like this. Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. And there will be only joy and happiness, tranquility, mindfulness and awareness. Such a life is blissful. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn9:43.1"><span class="parno">dn9:43.1</span>Poṭṭhapāda, if others should ask us, ‘But reverends, what is that reincarnation in a solid life-form for the giving up of which you teach?’ We’d answer like this, ‘<em>This</em> is that reincarnation in a solid life-form.’ </p>



<p id="dn9:44.1"><span class="parno">dn9:44.1</span>If others should ask us, ‘But reverends, what is that reincarnation in a mind-made life-form?’ We’d answer like this, ‘<em>This</em> is that reincarnation in a mind-made life-form.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha points to the experience to demonstrate what he is talking about, rather than offering a long theoretical explanation. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Ayaṁ</i> is a pronoun of presence, used to indicate what is apparent before the subject.</span></span></span></p>

When reincarnated in a formless life-form, it’s not referred to as a solid or mind-made life-form, only as a formless life-form. </p>



<p id="dn9:49.7"><span class="parno">dn9:49.7</span>Citta, suppose they were to ask you, ‘Did you exist in the past?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This anticipates one of the great philosophical debates of sectarian Buddhists which gave rise to the Sarvāstivāda, the school whose core doctrine was that “all exists (in the past, future, and present)”.

<p id="dn9:49.12"><span class="parno">dn9:49.12</span>“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer like this, ‘I did exist in the past. I will exist in the future. I do exist now.’ That’s how I’d answer.” </p>

In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name. These are the world’s common usages, terms, expressions, and descriptions, which the Realized One uses to communicate without getting stuck on them.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Words such as “self” have a conventional usage and in that context are perfectly fine. But what that “self” refers to is constantly changing, as it is reincarnated in different states. It is like a river which keeps the same name even though the water is always changing. If, driven by attachment, we assume there is a metaphysical reality underlying the conventional “self”, we step beyond what can be empirically verified. Note, however, that the Buddha is <em>not</em> asserting that there are two levels of truth, conventional and ultimate, a distinction not found in early Buddhism. <br> Compare <a href="../mn/mn139.html#content">MN139</a>, <a href="../mn/mn74.html#content">MN74</a>, <a href="../sn/sn1.25.html#content">SN1.25</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn9:54.1"><span class="parno">dn9:54.1</span>When he had spoken, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="dn9:56.1"><span class="parno">dn9:56.1</span>And Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In <a href="../an/an6.60.html#content">AN6.60</a> we find Citta Hatthisāriputta, still a somewhat junior monk, rudely interrupting his seniors. After admonition he disrobed, but he ordained again and later achieved arahantship. We can reconcile these two accounts by recognizing that the phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">acira</i> “not long after” is a conventional term, which might be several years. Thus the events of AN 6.60 occurred some time between his ordination and awakening.</span></span></span> He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.” </p>
