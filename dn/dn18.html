<h3 class="subheading">1. Declaring the Rebirths of People From Ñātika and Elsewhere </h3>



<p id="dn18:1.1"><span class="parno">dn18:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This picks up from the events of <a href="../dn/dn16.html#content">DN16</a>, which however discusses only the Ñātikans (who are reckoned among the Vajjis). Like <a href="../dn/dn17.html#content">DN17</a>, it bears many signs of a late sutta. The overall theme is the presence of a cosmic order where the liberating teaching of the Buddha is reconciled with the requirements of worldly power.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn18:1.3"><span class="parno">dn18:1.3</span>Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and Mallas, Cetīs and Vacchas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This list of ten nations is unique. The omission of the Aṅgas and Magadhans is noted below. The more famous list of “sixteen nations” adds Avanti and Assaka in the south, and Gandhāra and Kamboja in the north-west (eg. <a href="../an/an3.70.html#16great">AN3.70</a>). The Buddha did not visit these lands, which explains why they are omitted.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn18:1.4"><span class="parno">dn18:1.4</span>“This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there. </p>



<p id="dn18:1.5"><span class="parno">dn18:1.5</span>Over fifty devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Devotees” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">paricāraka</i>, which normally means “servant”. It is not in the relevant passages of DN16. This sense is found in only a couple of other places, both late (<a href="../snp/snp5.18.html#content">Snp5.18</a>, <a href="../vi/kd1.html#paricaraka">Khandhaka 1</a>).</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn18:1.6"><span class="parno">dn18:1.6</span>More than ninety devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>



<p id="dn18:1.7"><span class="parno">dn18:1.7</span>More than five hundred devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” </p>



<p id="dn18:2.1"><span class="parno">dn18:2.1</span>When the devotees of Ñātika heard about the Buddha’s answers to those questions, they became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness. </p>



<p id="dn18:3.1"><span class="parno">dn18:3.1</span>Venerable Ānanda heard of the Buddha’s statements and the Ñātikans’ happiness. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Ānanda’s Suggestion </h3>



<p id="dn18:4.1"><span class="parno">dn18:4.1</span>Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “But there were also Magadhan devotees—many, and of long standing too—who have passed away.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Bearing in mind that none of the nations were actually mentioned in the relevant Mahāparinibbānasutta passage, this whole introduction is framed to emphasize the importance of Magadha to Buddhism, especially given the problematic character of Ajātasattu. In the decades following the Buddha’s death, the Buddhist community adapted to a new political landscape which for a time saw the entirety of Buddhism contained within the sprawling Magadhan empire.</span></span></span> You’d think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away! But they too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled their ethics. The Buddha hasn’t declared their passing. It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn18:4.7"><span class="parno">dn18:4.7</span>That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As we known from <a href="../dn/dn2.html#content">DN2</a>, Bimbisāra had recently been murdered by Ajātasattu.</span></span></span> People still sing his praises: ‘That just and principled king, who made us so happy, has passed away. Life was good under his dominion.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A not-so-subtle hint of the changes under Ajātasattu. The passing of Bimbisāra signifies the crumbling of the social order that prevailed in the Buddha’s lifetime, bringing with it the immediate threat of war and chaos. This sutta establishes a timeless order that persists while worldly conditions fluctuate.</span></span></span> He too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled his ethics. People say: ‘Until his dying day, King Bimbisāra sang the Buddha’s praises!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Elsewhere the suttas say that Bimbisāra went for refuge (<a href="../dn/dn4.html#dn4:6.28">DN4</a>), while the Vinaya says he was in fact a stream-enterer (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#bimbisara">Khandhaka 1</a>), which is confirmed below. The Jains, however, claim him as one of their own but say he went to hell for committing suicide. Like his son Ajātasattu, it is likely that he frequented several teachers in his realm.</span></span></span> The Buddha hasn’t declared his passing. It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place. </p>



<p id="dn18:4.15"><span class="parno">dn18:4.15</span>Besides, the Buddha was awakened in Magadha;<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Near the town of  Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the place known today as Bodhgaya.</span></span></span> so why hasn’t he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn18:5.1"><span class="parno">dn18:5.1</span>After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private, Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by saying, “Why hasn’t the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.” Then Ānanda, after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Suggestion” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">parikathaṁ</i>, which elsewhere occurs in the Vinaya (<a href="../vi/kd7.html#parikatham">Khandhaka 7</a>) and the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga in the sense of “hint”.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn18:7.1"><span class="parno">dn18:7.1</span>Soon after Ānanda had left, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Ñātika for alms. He wandered for alms in Ñātika. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he washed his feet and entered the brick house. He paid attention, applied the mind, and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees, and sat on the seat spread out, thinking,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally <i lang="pi" translate="no">aṭṭhiṁ katvā manasikatvā sabbaṁ cetasā samannāharitvā</i> describes listening to Dhamma. This whole process seems unusually laborious.</span></span></span> “I shall know their destiny, where they are reborn in the next life.” And he saw where they had been reborn. </p>



<p id="dn18:7.6"><span class="parno">dn18:7.6</span>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat. Emerging from the brick house, he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porch. </p>



<p id="dn18:8.1"><span class="parno">dn18:8.1</span>Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, you look so serene; your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your faculties. Have you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today, sir?” </p>



<p id="dn18:9.1"><span class="parno">dn18:9.1</span>The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to Ānanda, revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees. He continued: </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. Janavasabha the Spirit </h3><a id="Janavasabha"></a>



<p id="dn18:9.5"><span class="parno">dn18:9.5</span>“Then, Ānanda, an invisible spirit called out: ‘I am Janavasabha, Blessed One! I am Janavasabha, Holy One!’ Ānanda, do you recall having previously heard such a name as Janavasabha?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Nāmadheyyaṁ</i> means “name (borne by someone or something)”, not “one who bears the name” (<a href="../mn/mn50.html#namadheyya">MN50</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn18:9.9"><span class="parno">dn18:9.9</span>“No, worthy sir. But when I heard the word, I got goosebumps! I thought, ‘This must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as Janavasabha.’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Janavasabha</i> is “chief of men”, spelled <i lang="pi" translate="no">janesabha</i> at <a href="../dn/dn20.html#janesabha">DN20</a> and <a href="../dn/dn32.html#janesabha">DN32</a>. The synonym <i lang="pi" translate="no">narāsabha</i> is an occasional poetic epithet of the Buddha (<a href="../snp/snp3.11.html#narāsabha">Snp3.11</a>, <a href="../snp/snp5.1.html#narāsabha">Snp 5.1</a>, <a href="../sn/sn11.3.html#narāsabha">SN11.3</a>). In Sanskrit we find <i lang="pi" translate="no">puruṣaṛṣabha</i> in the same sense.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn18:10.1"><span class="parno">dn18:10.1</span>“After making himself heard while vanished, Ānanda, a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of me.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Uḷāravaṇṇa</i> describes beautiful people at <a href="../mn/mn96.html#ularavaṇṇa">MN96</a>.</span></span></span> And for a second time he called out: ‘I am Bimbisāra, Blessed One! I am Bimbisāra, Holy One! This is the seventh time I am reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa. When I pass away from here, I can become a king of men.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Read <i lang="pi" translate="no">ito</i>. I think this implies what is stated more explicitly in Anuruddha’s partly parallel verses at <a href="../tha/tha16.html#anuruddha">Therigatha 16 verses 892-919</a>: after each of seven rebirths under Vessavaṇa he can become a king of men. This explains the name Janavasabha.</span></span></span></p>

Just now, sir, I had been sent out by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king Virūḷhaka’s presence on some business, and on the way I saw the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devotees. But it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assembly. It occurred to me, “I shall see the Buddha and inform him of this.” These are the two reasons I’ve come to see the Buddha. </p>

<p id="dn18:12.1"><span class="parno">dn18:12.1</span>Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the entry to the rainy season—when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is not just the Vajjis and the Buddhist Saṅgha who meet frequently in a hall to discuss business, but the gods as well.

How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Everything Sanaṅkumāra says is just a bit off. Here he adopts an idiom commonly used by the Buddha, but in third person rather than the Buddha’s second person; and he asks only rhetorically, where the Buddha engages with his audience. If it were only this one example it would mean nothing, but similar changes happen throughout. I believe this is a subtle literary device that tells two narratives to two audiences. To potential converts it sounds like Sanaṅkumāra is giving a ringing and learned endorsement of Buddhism, while to knowledgeable Buddhists he appears as less than well versed in the teachings. I note these eccentric wordings as we proceed.</span></span></span> For consider those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have fulfilled their ethics. When their bodies break up, after death, some are reborn in the company of the gods who control what is imagined by others, some with the gods who love to imagine, some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some with the gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four great kings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sutta began by recounting those who have achieved various stages of awakening. But escape from rebirth threatens the gods; this potentially fraught relationship is played out in <a href="../mn/mn49.html#content">MN 49</a>. Sanaṅkumāra is preempting such arguments by pointing out that many of the Buddha’s followers are reborn among the gods and do not escape transmigration, at least not for now. This is no trivial metaphysical argument. In order for Buddhism to prevail, it must show that its radical soteriology is compatible with worldly prosperity, lest it face opposition from kings and other temporal powers. The gods act as proxies to demonstrate the appropriate behavior for terrestrial kings. This is why the leading character is Bimbisāra/Janavasabha, who straddles the two realms.</span></span></span> And at the very least they swell the hosts of the centaurs.” </p>

And Venerable Ānanda, having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha, informed the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here Ānanda plays a key role as the linchpin of the oral tradition. It is likely that not just the Mahāparinibbānasutta itself, but all these suttas of this cycle were composed by Ānanda or his students.</span></span></span></p>

<p>And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">With this unique ending, there is no claim that this sutta was heard by the mendicants in the usual way. Rather it makes its purpose explicit, to act as a means to widely propagate the Dhamma. The Mahāparinibbānasutta also speaks of the spread of the Dhamma, and the Janavasabhasutta indicates some of the means by which that was achieved in the decades following the Buddha’s death; in particular, by allying itself with the ascendant power of Magadha.</span></span></span></p>
