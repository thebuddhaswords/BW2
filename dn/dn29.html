<p id="dn29:1.1"><span class="parno">dn29:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to those Sakyans named Vedhaññā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Vedhaññās are not mentioned elsewhere; their name means “Marksmen”.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn29:1.3"><span class="parno">dn29:1.3</span>Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When this event is mentioned at <a href="../mn/mn104.html#content">MN104</a>, the Buddha is also in the Sakyan lands, but near the village of Sāma. Both texts tell the story of Cunda conveying the news via Ānanda at Sāma, which was presumably near the Vedhaññā’s mango grove. It does seem strange that two distinct discourses are recorded from the same prompt, but then, why shouldn’t the Buddha give more than one teaching on such an important topic? At <a href="../dn/dn33.html#dn33:1.6.1">DN 33:1.6.1</a> the Buddha is at Pāvā in the Mallian lands, and the discourse is spoken by Sāriputta there. Given the evident lateness of DN33, this is a less convincing framework. A parallel to MN104 (MA 196 at T i 752c12) says he was in the Vajjian lands at the time; both Sakya and Vajji border on Mallā. Jain tradition holds Mahāvīra died after the Buddha, and it was at a different Pāvā in Magadha near Nāḷandā, perhaps the place known in Pali as Pāvārika’s mango grove (<a href="../dn/dn11.html#content">DN11:1.1</a>). The earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s death, the Kalpasutra, is, however, much later than the Buddhist sources, and does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha.</span></span></span> With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While this description of the Jains might seem like sheer sectarian calumny, it is a fact that the Jain tradition is split into two sects, the “sky-clad” Digambara, whose male ascetics went naked, and the “white-clad” Śvetāmbara who wear an unstitched cloth. Jain tradition holds that the split occurred about a century later, in the reign of Candragupta Maurya.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn29:1.5"><span class="parno">dn29:1.5</span>“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” </p>



<p id="dn29:1.6"><span class="parno">dn29:1.6</span>You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A slight on the movement whose signature virtue was non-violence.</span></span></span> And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“With broken monument” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhinnathupe</i>) is used only in this context. When a great teacher or leader died, a “monument” was built to keep their memory alive. The breaking of a monument—whether physical or symbolic—was, in a way, truly killing them.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn29:2.1"><span class="parno">dn29:2.1</span>And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Cunda took the time to complete his rains residence before conveying the news, reminding us of the speed with which news traveled in those days—slowly. <br>
Apart from the events described here, we hear of Sāma only once (<a href="../an/an6.21.html#content">AN 6.21</a>). The topic there is the decline of the Saṅgha, hinting at a connection with these events.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn29:2.4"><span class="parno">dn29:2.4</span>Ānanda said to him, “Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and tell him about this.” </p>



<p id="dn29:2.7"><span class="parno">dn29:2.7</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn29:3.1"><span class="parno">dn29:3.1</span>Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. The Teaching of the Unawakened </h3><a id="vattati"></a>



<p id="dn29:4.1"><span class="parno">dn29:4.1</span>“That’s what happens, Cunda, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This harsh critique is repeated at <a href="../dn/dn33.html#poorlytaught">DN33:1.7.4</a>, but not at <a href="../mn/mn104.html#content">MN104:5.1</a>, where the Buddha’s response focuses on his own community.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn29:4.2"><span class="parno">dn29:4.2</span>Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings, does not practice following that procedure, does not live in line with the teaching. They proceed having turned away from that teaching.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally we find <i lang="pi" translate="no">vokkamma</i> (“having turned away”) in the sense of straying from the Dhamma. But this passage shows the phrase is, in itself, neutral, as it is good to turn from a bad teaching.</span></span></span> You should say this to them, ‘You’re fortunate, reverend, you’re so very fortunate! For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. But you don’t practice in line with that teaching, you don’t practice following that procedure, you don’t live in line with the teaching. You proceed having turned away from that teaching.’ In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame, but the disciple deserves praise.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Dhamma is primary, not the teacher. This is applied to Buddhism as well; for example, a student is expected to help a mentor who is falling away from Dhamma (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#support">Khandhaka 1 verse 332- </a>).</span></span></span> Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ‘Come on, venerable, practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher.’ The one who encourages, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices accordingly all brim with much wickedness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare <a href="../an/an1.320.html#content">AN1.320</a>.</span></span></span> Why is that? It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn29:5.1"><span class="parno">dn29:5.1</span>Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teachings, practices following that procedure, lives in line with the teaching. They proceed having undertaken that teaching. You should say this to them, ‘It’s your loss, reverend, it’s your misfortune! For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. And you practice in line with that teaching, you practice following that procedure, you live in line with the teaching. You proceed having undertaken that teaching.’ In such a case the teacher, the teaching, and the disciple are all to blame. Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ‘Clearly the venerable is practicing systematically and will succeed in that system.’ The one who praises, the one who they praise, and the one who, being praised, rouses up even more energy all brim with much wickedness. Why is that? It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Teaching of the Awakened </h3>



<p id="dn29:6.1"><span class="parno">dn29:6.1</span>Take the case where a teacher is awakened, and the teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha.

You proceed having turned away from that teaching.’ In such a case the teacher and the teaching deserve praise, but the disciple is to blame. Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ‘Come on, venerable, practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher.’ The one who encourages, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices accordingly all brim with much merit. Why is that? It’s because that teaching and training is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn29:7.1"><span class="parno">dn29:7.1</span>Take the case where a teacher is awakened, and the teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teachings, practices following that procedure, lives in line with the teaching. They proceed having undertaken that teaching.

<h3 class="subheading">3. When Disciples Have Regrets </h3>



<p id="dn29:8.1"><span class="parno">dn29:8.1</span>Take the case where a teacher arises in the world who is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened. But the disciples have not been educated in the meaning of that good teaching. And the spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure has not been disclosed and revealed to them; its sayings have not all been collected; and it has not been well proclaimed with its demonstrable basis wherever there are gods and humans.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Collected sayings” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅgāhapada</i>. This is a unique term, but the sense seems to be that the process of gathering  and organizing teachings is incomplete. I take the negative <i lang="pi" translate="no">na</i> to be distributed separately among the clauses.</span></span></span> And then their teacher passes away. When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets. Why is that? They think: ‘Our teacher was perfected, a fully awakened Buddha. His teaching was well explained, but we were not educated in its meaning. And the spiritual practice was not fully disclosed and revealed to us; its sayings have not all been collected; and it has not been well proclaimed with its demonstrable basis wherever there are gods and humans. And then our teacher passed away.’ When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">4. When Disciples Have No Regrets </h3>



<p id="dn29:9.1"><span class="parno">dn29:9.1</span>Take the case where a teacher arises in the world who is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.

And the spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure has been disclosed and revealed to them; its sayings have all been collected; and it has been well proclaimed with its demonstrable basis wherever there are gods and humans.

And then our teacher passed away.’ When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are free of regrets. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">5. On the Incomplete Spiritual Path, Etc. </h3>

<p id="dn29:16.1"><span class="parno">dn29:16.1</span>Of all the teachers in the world today, Cunda, I don’t see even a single one who has reached the peak of material things and fame like me. Of all the spiritual communities and groups in the world today, Cunda, I don’t see even a single one who has reached the pinnacle of material things and fame like the mendicant Saṅgha. And if there’s any spiritual path of which it may be rightly said that it’s endowed with all good qualities, complete in all good qualities, neither too little nor too much, well explained, whole, full, and well propounded, it’s of this spiritual path that this should be said. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn29:16.8"><span class="parno">dn29:16.8</span>Uddaka son of Rāma used to say:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">One of the Brahmanical sages under whom the Bodhisatta practiced before awakening (<a href="../mn/mn26.html#Uddaka">MN26</a>). Another of his enigmatic sayings is found at <a href="../sn/sn35.103.html#content">SN35.103</a>. When the Bodhisatta began his study, he first learned to recite the scriptures, and in these two passages we find examples of what those scriptures were.</span></span></span> ‘Seeing, one does not see.’ But seeing what does one not see? You can see the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not the edge.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sharp razors were known even in Vedic times (Rig Veda 8.4.16).</span></span></span> Thus it is said: ‘Seeing, one does not see.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7. There, the Self is said to be hidden in a body like a razor in its case. People do not see it (<i lang="pi" translate="no">taṁ na paśyanti</i>), for they only see the partial and incomplete functions of the Self, such as breathing, speaking, and so on. Seeing only the aspects, they do not see that each aspect is an expression of the one whole. This confirms that Uddaka was a Brahmanical teacher who was familiar with this passage. Similar phrases, but without the razor simile, are found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.23 and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1.</span></span></span> But that saying of Uddaka’s is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless, as it’s only about a razor. If there’s anything of which it may be rightly said: ‘Seeing, one does not see,’ it’s of this that it should be said. Seeing what does one not see? One sees this: a spiritual path endowed with all good qualities, complete in all good qualities, neither too little nor too much, well explained, whole, full, and well propounded. One does not see this: anything that, were it to be removed, would make it purer. One does not see this: anything that, were it to be added, would make it more complete. Thus it is rightly said: ‘Seeing, one does not see.’ </p>

<p id="dn29:17.1"><span class="parno">dn29:17.1</span>So, Cunda, you should all come together and recite in concert, without disputing, those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Recite in concert” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅgīti</i>.

They are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha outlines the topics to be recited, which are the main chapters of the Saṁyutta Nikāya.</span></span></span> These are the things I have taught from my own direct knowledge. </p>

I have allowed almsfood for you that suffices only to sustain this body, avoid harm, and support spiritual practice; so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and will keep on living blamelessly and at ease. I have allowed lodgings for you that suffice only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.

<h3 class="subheading">9. Indulgence in Pleasure </h3>



<p id="dn29:23.1"><span class="parno">dn29:23.1</span>It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say, ‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This repurposes the phrase used right at the beginning of the Buddha’s first teaching, the Dhammacakkappavattasutta (<a href="../sn/sn56.11.htm#content">SN56.11</a>). There he was persuading hard-bitten ascetics that he did not indulge in sensual pleasures. While the affiliation of those five ascetics is not stated explicitly, clearly their practices were similar to the Jains. And given the context, no doubt the Buddha has the Jains in mind here.</span></span></span> You should say to them, ‘What is that indulgence in pleasure? For there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasure.’ </p>



<p id="dn29:23.6"><span class="parno">dn29:23.6</span>These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure, Cunda, are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. What four? </p>

<p id="dn29:24.9"><span class="parno">dn29:24.9</span>Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption.

<p id="dn29:24.11"><span class="parno">dn29:24.11</span>Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption.

<p id="dn29:25.6"><span class="parno">dn29:25.6</span>Firstly, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This is the first fruit and benefit. </p>



<p id="dn29:25.8"><span class="parno">dn29:25.8</span>Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—becomes a once-returner.

<p id="dn29:25.10"><span class="parno">dn29:25.10</span>Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. This is the third fruit and benefit. </p>



<p id="dn29:25.12"><span class="parno">dn29:25.12</span>Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the fourth fruit and benefit. </p>



<p id="dn29:25.14"><span class="parno">dn29:25.14</span>These four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Some meditation teachers warn of the supposed dangers of becoming attached to the pleasure of meditation.

Both places are glossed as <i lang="pi" translate="no">ṭhitasabhāvā</i>. It seems this is in reference to the fact that the Buddhist Vinaya is gentle and flexible.

<h3 class="subheading">12. Questions and Answers </h3>



<p id="dn29:27.1"><span class="parno">dn29:27.1</span>It’s possible that wanderers of other religions might say, ‘The ascetic Gotama demonstrates boundless knowledge and vision of the past, but not of the future.

<p id="dn29:27.4"><span class="parno">dn29:27.4</span>Regarding the past, the Realized One has knowledge stemming from memory. He recollects as far as he wants. </p>



<p id="dn29:27.6"><span class="parno">dn29:27.6</span>Regarding the future, the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakening:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha claims no gift of prophecy, unlike some other sages, but he knows that which matters.</span></span></span> ‘This is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’ </p>



<p id="dn29:28.1"><span class="parno">dn29:28.1</span>If a question about the past is untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply. If a question about the past is true and correct, but pointless, he does not reply. If a question about the past is true, correct, and beneficial, he knows the right time to reply. And the Realized One replies to questions about the future or the present in the same way. </p>



<p id="dn29:28.8"><span class="parno">dn29:28.8</span>And so the Realized One has speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.

<p id="dn29:29.1"><span class="parno">dn29:29.1</span>In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.

<p id="dn29:29.3"><span class="parno">dn29:29.3</span>From the night when the Realized One awakens to the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—in the element of extinguishment with no residue—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.

<p id="dn29:29.5"><span class="parno">dn29:29.5</span>The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. Since this is so, that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

The Buddhist path is integrated, so one part always implies the whole.</span></span></span> What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
