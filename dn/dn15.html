<h2>1. Dependent Origination </h2>


<p id="dn15:1.1"><span class="parno">dn15:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his <em>The Great Discourse on Causation</em>. It is the longest and most complex discourse on dependent origination in early Buddhism.</span></span></span></span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Kurukṣetra was an ancient Brahmanical kingdom situated in the region around modern Delhi, bordered by the Ganges in the east, the Sarasvatī in the west, the Himalayas in the north, and the hills of the Aravalli Range in the south. The Mahābharata climaxes with the battle fought there between the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. These events, to the extent that they can be established historically, took place several centuries before the Buddha. Kuru marks the north-western extent of the Buddha’s travels. Kammāsadamma is identified with modern Kumashpur in Haryana, about 40 km north of Delhi.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:1.3"><span class="parno">dn15:1.3</span>Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While we cannot date this text, the fact that Ānanda has evidently been studying deep matters for a long time, that it takes place outside the Buddha’s accustomed locales, and that it builds on teachings found elsewhere, suggests that it happened rather late in the Buddha’s life. At <a href="../sn/sn12.60.html#content">SN12.60</a> we find the same introduction to a much shorter discourse.</span></span></span> “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At <a href="../sn/sn6.1.html#content">SN6.1</a> (and <a href="../dn/dn14.html#dn14:3.1.3">DN14</a> in the case of Vipassī), the Buddha hesitated to teach the Dhamma because dependent origination is so hard to see. Ānanda was not only learned and wise, he was a stream enterer who had directly experienced dependent origination (<a href="../an/an10.92.html#">AN10.92</a>), yet he still underestimates it.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn15:1.6"><span class="parno">dn15:1.6</span>“Don’t say that, Ānanda, don’t say that! This dependent origination is deep and appears deep.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sutta introduce subtle variations in the standard formula as a means to illuminate hidden implications and dimensions.</span></span></span> It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha establishes the primary purpose of dependent origination: to understand transmigration so as to be free from it.</span></span></span></p>

<a id="upadana"></a>

<p id="dn15:2.1"><span class="parno">dn15:2.1</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Dependent origination is here taught in “reverse order” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭiloma</i>, <a href="../ud/ud1.2.html#content">Ud1.2</a>), starting with the existential problem: we are all going to die. This factor and the next are resultant, so we cannot solve them directly.</span></span></span> If they say, ‘What is a requirement for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">With this the Buddha denies the promise of immortality in this or any other realm.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:2.3"><span class="parno">dn15:2.3</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Continued existence” (or “life”) is an encompassing term, including both resultant and causal dimensions.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:2.5"><span class="parno">dn15:2.5</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘Grasping is a requirement for continued existence.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Grasping” and “craving” (together with “ignorance” in the full sequence) are the defilements that drive the process on. It is here that the practice of the path takes effect, uprooting them entirely.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:2.7"><span class="parno">dn15:2.7</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘Craving is a requirement for grasping.’ </p>



<p id="dn15:2.9"><span class="parno">dn15:2.9</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for craving?’ you should answer, ‘Feeling is a requirement for craving.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The next three factors spell out the process of sense experience that unfolds automatically. Meditation slows it down so it can be seen clearly, but the process remains even for the perfected ones.</span></span></span></p>

<a id="namarupa"></a>

<p id="dn15:2.11"><span class="parno">dn15:2.11</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘Contact is a requirement for feeling.’ </p>



<p id="dn15:2.13"><span class="parno">dn15:2.13</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for contact?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are requirements for contact.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we encounter the first unique feature of this sequence, as normally the six sense fields appear as the condition for contact. The reason for this special presentation becomes clear later on.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:2.15"><span class="parno">dn15:2.15</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘Consciousness is a requirement for name and form.’ </p>



<p id="dn15:2.17"><span class="parno">dn15:2.17</span>When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a requirement for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are requirements for consciousness.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The mutual conditioning of consciousness with name and form is a further subtlety of this presentation. We have met this idea before in <a href="../dn/dn14.html#dn14:2.18.36">DN14</a>; it also occurs in <a href="../sn/sn12.65.html#content">SN12.65</a> and <a href="../sn/sn12.67.html#content">SN12.67</a>. Again, implications of this are explored below.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn15:3.1"><span class="parno">dn15:3.1</span>So: name and form are requirements for consciousness. Consciousness is a requirement for name and form. Name and form are requirements for contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling. Feeling is a requirement for craving. Craving is a requirement for grasping. Grasping is a requirement for continued existence. Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth. Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sequence is recapped in forward order (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anuloma</i>, <a href="../ud/ud1.1.html#content">Ud1.1</a>).</span></span></span> That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:4.1"><span class="parno">dn15:4.1</span>‘Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha now takes up each of the terms in more depth.</span></span></span> Suppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhere.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This emphatic phrasing drives home that “cessation” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nirodha</i>) is not simply temporary suppression or non-arising, but permanent and complete absence.</span></span></span> That is, there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realms—of gods, centaurs, spirits, creatures, humans, quadrupeds, birds, or reptiles, each into their own realm. When there’s no rebirth at all, with the cessation of rebirth, would old age and death still be found?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Rebirth” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jāti</i>) is defined as the birth of a new life, not as simple arising.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn15:4.4"><span class="parno">dn15:4.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn15:4.5"><span class="parno">dn15:4.5</span>“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of old age and death, namely rebirth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The various terms for “cause” are used as synonyms (<i lang="pi" translate="no">hetu</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">nidāna</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">samudaya</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">paccaya</i>). The purpose of using different terms is not to add nuances, but to reinforce the central meaning and guard against the corruption of meaning; if one word is lost or misunderstood, the meaning of the sentence as a whole is not changed.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:5.1"><span class="parno">dn15:5.1</span>‘Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhere. That is, continued existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, or the formless realm. When there’s no continued existence at all, with the cessation of continued existence, would rebirth still be found?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These realms relate to the kamma that projects consciousness into them. The realms of “luminous form” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">rūpabhava</i>) and the “formless” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">arūpabhava</i>) are generated by the form and formless attainments respectively. Any other kamma, good or bad, pertains to the sensual realm (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kāmabhava</i>). All rebirth takes place in one or other of these realms.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:5.4"><span class="parno">dn15:5.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn15:5.5"><span class="parno">dn15:5.5</span>“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of rebirth, namely continued existence. </p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:6.1"><span class="parno">dn15:6.1</span>‘Grasping is a requirement for continued existence’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no grasping for anyone anywhere. That is, grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. When there’s no grasping at all, with the cessation of grasping, would continued existence still be found?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Grasping” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">upādāna</i>) begins with the primal desire of the senses, but the three other graspings are rather intellectual and sophisticated. Only a grown human being with a developed linguistic ability is able to formulate a view to become attached to, and likewise with attachment to religious observances and vows, and to theories of a self. This is why the bulk of kamma is produced by adult humans, rather than by, say, animals or children, for whom these dimensions of grasping are nascent.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:6.4"><span class="parno">dn15:6.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn15:6.5"><span class="parno">dn15:6.5</span>“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of continued existence, namely grasping. </p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:7.1"><span class="parno">dn15:7.1</span>‘Craving is a requirement for grasping’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere. That is, craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas. When there’s no craving at all, with the cessation of craving, would grasping still be found?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Craving” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">taṇhā</i>) is a fundamental desire or urge. Unlike grasping, it is fully active in children and animals. Often it has a threefold definition, which we find below, but in dependent origination it is usually defined in terms of the six senses, which relates it to the items to come.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:7.4"><span class="parno">dn15:7.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn15:7.5"><span class="parno">dn15:7.5</span>“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of grasping, namely craving. </p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:8.1"><span class="parno">dn15:8.1</span>‘Feeling is a requirement for craving’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no feeling for anyone anywhere. That is, feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would craving still be found?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The usual threefold definition of feeling (pleasant, painful, neutral) is reframed in terms of the six senses.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:8.4"><span class="parno">dn15:8.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn15:8.5"><span class="parno">dn15:8.5</span>“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of craving, namely feeling. </p>


<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p id="dn15:9.1"><span class="parno">dn15:9.1</span>So it is, Ānanda, that feeling gives rise to craving. Craving gives rise to seeking. Seeking gives rise to gaining material things. Gaining material things gives rise to evaluation. Evaluation gives rise to desire and lust. Desire and lust gives rise to attachment. Attachment gives rise to ownership. Ownership gives rise to stinginess. Stinginess gives rise to safeguarding.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha introduces another, even more radical, departure from the typical sequence. Rather than continue back to contact and name and form, he branches out in an entirely new direction. These “nine things rooted in craving” are found independently at <a href="../an/an9.23.html#content">AN9.23</a> and <a href="../dn/dn34.html#9things">DN34</a>, but only here are they integrated with the standard dependent origination.</span></span></span> Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the purpose of the main dependent origination is to disclose the web of conditions that generates the suffering of transmigration, here the Buddha looks at the arising of social conflict and disorder.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn15:10.1"><span class="parno">dn15:10.1</span>‘Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In <a href="../dn/dn27.html#content">DN27</a> Aggaññasutta the Buddha narrates a legend showing how these things arise. The point is not that we should not safeguard (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ārakkha</i>) our possessions. It is, rather, that so long as we live in a world where safeguarding possessions is necessary, there will be conflict and violence.</span></span></span> Suppose there were totally and utterly no safeguarding for anyone anywhere. When there’s no safeguarding at all, with the cessation of safeguarding, would those many bad, unskillful things still come to be?” </p>


<hr>

<p id="dn15:23.1"><span class="parno">dn15:23.1</span>How do those who describe the self describe it?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text now turns to an analysis of theories of “self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">attā</i>), which is comparable to some of the passages of <a href="../dn/dn1.html#content">DN1</a>. The Buddha began his discourse by stating that it is the failure to understand dependent origination that keeps beings trapped in transmigration. Dependent origination explains transmigration in a purely empirical way by inferring from the mental and physical phenomena we experience here and now. Self theorists, on the other hand, explain transmigration by introducing a new metaphysical principle, the “self” or “soul”, by which they assume that the individual has an eternal underlying essence.</span></span></span>
 They describe it as formed and limited:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Formed” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">rūpī</i> (“possessing form”), identifying the self with the first of the five aggregates. If something were really the core essence of a person, you would think it is readily knowable. But the Buddha shows that theorists describe the self in multiple different and incompatible ways. Each of these draws on some more-or-less arbitrary aspect of empirical reality, such as “form”, to describe an unknowable metaphysical entity that is in fact just pure supposition.</span></span></span> ‘My self is formed and limited.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An example of a self that is “physical and limited” would be the body.</span></span></span> Or they describe it as formed and infinite: ‘My self is formed and infinite.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Such as the cosmos.</span></span></span> Or they describe it as formless and limited: ‘My self is formless and limited.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Perhaps this is the self of “limited perception” (<a href="../dn/dn1.html#limitedperception">DN1</a>). This would be where the mind is aware of something limited, and the self is identified with the mental dimension of that awareness.</span></span></span> Or they describe it as formless and infinite: ‘My self is formless and infinite.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Such as the formless dimensions.</span></span></span></p>

The self is still defined <em>in relation to</em> feeling, but it is a negative relation. Such theories are commonly found in the Upaniṣads, where a prominent thread of analysis systematically rejects all the things that are <em>not</em> the self (<i lang="pi" translate="no">neti</i>), before finally arriving at what <em>is</em> the self (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.15).</span></span></span> Or they regard it like this: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the theorist describes feeling as a function of the self: it is not what the self <em>is</em>, but what the self <em>does</em>. At <a href="../mn/mn38.html#whatselfdoes">MN38</a> (= <a href="../mn/mn2.html#whatselfdoes">MN2</a>), Sāti describes the self as consciousness, “the speaker and feeler who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms”.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn15:29.1"><span class="parno">dn15:29.1</span>Pleasant feelings, painful feelings, and neutral feelings are all impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.</p>

<hr>

<p> When feeling a pleasant feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their pleasant feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has expired.’ When feeling a painful feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their painful feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has expired.’ When feeling a neutral feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their neutral feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has expired.’ </p>

<p>So those who say ‘feeling is my self’ regard as self that which is evidently impermanent, mixed with pleasure and pain, and liable to rise and fall. That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard feeling as self. </p>



<p id="dn15:30.1"><span class="parno">dn15:30.1</span>Now, as to those who say: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling.’ You should say this to them, ‘But reverend, where there is nothing felt at all, would the thought “I am” occur there?’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Feeling is part of the fundamental structure of consciousness. This argument comes through more clearly in Pali, for the word for “feeling” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vedanā</i>) is derived from and still lies close to the sense of “knowing, experiencing”. Thus the question is, “If there was no mind, would there be the thought ‘I am this’?” The commentary explains that this refers to the bare material realm which is devoid of consciousness. The commentary appears to support the variant reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">ahamasmī</i> here. This makes sense in context, for “I am” is the first and most primordial assertion of a self, while “I am this” is a more sophisticated identification of the self in relation to the aggregates.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn15:31.1"><span class="parno">dn15:31.1</span>Now, as to those who say: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’ You should say this to them, ‘Suppose feelings were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over. When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would the thought “I am this” occur there?’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The theorist avoids identifying feeling as the self, but they must identify <em>something</em> as the self (as for example, Sāti said the self was <i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>). Feeling, however, is deeply wound into the structure of consciousness, so if feeling were to be utterly absent, no other mental phenomena could continue, and there would therefore be no possibility of forming a theory of self.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn15:32.1"><span class="parno">dn15:32.1</span>Not regarding anything in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Letting go is not just a conceptual matter, it has immediate emotional consequences. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Paritassati</i> conveys the twin senses of desire and agitation, for which “anxiety” seems the best fit.</span></span></span> They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ </p>



<p id="dn15:32.5"><span class="parno">dn15:32.5</span>It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant whose mind is freed like this holds the following views: ‘A realized one still exists after death’; ‘A realized one no longer exists after death’; ‘A realized one both still exists and no longer exists after death’; ‘A realized one neither still exists nor no longer exists after death’. </p>



<p id="dn15:32.10"><span class="parno">dn15:32.10</span>Why is that? A mendicant is freed by directly knowing this: how far labeling and the scope of labeling extend; how far terminology and the scope of terminology extend; how far description and the scope of description extend; how far wisdom and the sphere of wisdom extend; how far the cycle of rebirths and its continuation extend. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant freed by directly knowing this holds the view: ‘There is no such thing as knowing and seeing.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This recalls the similar statement above. Whereas there it was a statement about name and form with consciousness, here it is a description of the arahant who has fully realized it. Unlike the theorists whose views do not withstand empirical scrutiny, the arahant’s liberation is based on a direct understanding of reality.</span></span></span></p>
