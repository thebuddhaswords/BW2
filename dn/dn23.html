<div lang="en">

<p id="dn23:1.1"><span class="parno">dn23:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named Setavyā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kumārakassapa was ordained at twenty (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#Kumārakassapa">Khandhaka 1</a>). He features in the Vammikasutta (<a href="../mn/mn23.html#content">MN23</a>), and his verses are collected in the Theragāthā (<a href="../tha/tha2.html#Kumārakassapa">Theragatha 2 verse 201-202</a>). He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech (<a href="../an/an1.217.html#content">AN1.217</a>), apparently on the basis of this discourse. <br> The Pāyāsisuta is the only major Buddhist text that has a Jain parallel, Paesi-kahāṇayaṁ, a similar dialogue between Paesi and Keśin in Setavyā.</span></span></span> He stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Setavyā was north-east of Sāvatthī.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn23:1.4"><span class="parno">dn23:1.4</span>Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pāyāsi  was a <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i> yet he receives a <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmadeyya</i>. The sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmadeyya</i> as a donation to brahmins is well attested in inscriptions, so I think this is likely a mistake in the text, rather than evidence that the practice was not for brahmins only.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. On Pāyāsi </h3>

<p id="dn23:2.1"><span class="parno">dn23:2.1</span>Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception: “There is no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is wrong view per <a href="../mn/mn117.html#wrongview">MN117</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn23:2.3"><span class="parno">dn23:2.3</span>The brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard, “It seems the ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā. He has this good reputation: ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, exiting Setavyā, they formed into companies and headed north to the grove. </p>



<p id="dn23:3.1"><span class="parno">dn23:3.1</span>Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove, and addressed his butler, “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove?” </p>



<p id="dn23:3.5"><span class="parno">dn23:3.5</span>“The ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā. He has this good reputation: ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ They’re going to see that Kassapa the Prince.” </p>



<p id="dn23:3.9"><span class="parno">dn23:3.9</span>“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the chieftain Pāyāsi asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Kassapa the Prince.’ Before Kassapa the Prince persuades those foolish and incompetent brahmins and householders that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds—for none of these things are true!” </p>



<p id="dn23:3.15"><span class="parno">dn23:3.15</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked. </p>



<p id="dn23:4.1"><span class="parno">dn23:4.1</span>Then Pāyāsi escorted by the brahmins and householders, went up to Kassapa the Prince, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Setavyā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward Kassapa the Prince, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Nihilism </h3>



<p id="dn23:5.1"><span class="parno">dn23:5.1</span>Seated to one side, the chieftain Pāyāsi said to Venerable Kassapa the Prince, “Worthy Kassapa, this is my doctrine and view: ‘There is no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.’” </p>



<p id="dn23:5.4"><span class="parno">dn23:5.4</span>“Chieftain, may I never see or hear of anyone holding such a doctrine or view!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This idiom recurs at <a href="../an/an6.38.html#content">AN6.38</a> where, as here, it refers to a well-known view and cannot mean that they have never heard of it. There the text and commentary read <i lang="pi" translate="no">māhaṁ</i>, which with the aorist is prohibitive not negatory. It is an idiom expressing dislike.</span></span></span> For how on earth can anyone say such a thing? </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Simile of the Moon and Sun </h4>



<p id="dn23:5.8"><span class="parno">dn23:5.8</span>Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, chieftain? Are the moon and sun in this world or the other world? Are they gods or humans?” </p>



<p id="dn23:5.11"><span class="parno">dn23:5.11</span>“They are in the other world, worthy Kassapa, and they are gods, not humans.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the world “down here” is bogged down in its messy and ephemeral issues, the heavenly bodies proceed in their serene, glorious, stately indifference. Ignoring gravity, self-luminous, and apparently eternal, they operate according to what appears to be an entirely different set of rules, a “meta-physics”. What Newton did in physics the Buddha did in spirituality: show that the heavens, despite appearances, operate with the same set of conditioned rules as apply down here.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn23:5.12"><span class="parno">dn23:5.12</span>“By this method it ought to be proven that<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kassapa’s argument here doesn’t directly establish his conclusion. It is possible that gods exist on an entirely separate plane that has nothing to do with kamma and rebirth.</span></span></span> there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>



<p id="dn23:6.1"><span class="parno">dn23:6.1</span>“Even though the worthy Kassapa says this, still I think that there is no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>



<p id="dn23:6.3"><span class="parno">dn23:6.3</span>“Is there a method by which you can prove what you say?” </p>



<p id="dn23:6.5"><span class="parno">dn23:6.5</span>“There is, worthy Kassapa.” </p>



<p id="dn23:6.7"><span class="parno">dn23:6.7</span>“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>



<p id="dn23:6.8"><span class="parno">dn23:6.8</span>“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and are covetous, malicious, and have wrong view—when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is still a major factor in shaping belief. People will reject the opinions of experts and believe people that they know.</span></span></span> They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is the method by which I prove that there is no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42, where Varuṇa asphyxiated his son Bhṛgu in order to send him on a journey to the “other world”, inducing a near-death experience. Bhṛgu saw men cutting other men to pieces and eating them, and other sights both horrifying and beautiful, all the while wondering if what he saw was real, before his breath was returned to him.</span></span></span></p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Simile of the Bandit </h4>



<p id="dn23:7.1"><span class="parno">dn23:7.1</span>“Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, chieftain? Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to you, saying, ‘Sir, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ Then you’d say to them, ‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, at the place of execution to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ Saying, ‘Good,’ they’d do as they were told, sitting him down at the place of execution. Could that bandit get the executioners to wait, saying, ‘Please, good executioners! I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin in such and such village or town. Wait until I’ve visited them, then I’ll come back’? Or would they just chop off his head as he prattled on?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Follow PTS reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">uddassetvā</i>, which at <a href="../mn/mn82.html#uddassetvā">MN82</a> has the sense “visit”.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn23:7.13"><span class="parno">dn23:7.13</span>“They’d just chop off his head.” </p>



<p id="dn23:7.14"><span class="parno">dn23:7.14</span>“So even a human bandit couldn’t get his human executioners to stay his execution. What then of your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who are reborn in a lower realm after doing bad things? Could they get the wardens of hell to wait, saying, ‘Please, good wardens of hell! Wait until I’ve gone to the chieftain Pāyāsi to tell him that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds’? By this method, too, it ought to be proven that<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kassapa, however, has not established the existence of an afterlife, he has merely refuted Pāyāsi’s argument. Per Occam’s razor, the burden of proof lies on the one who wishes to establish the existence of the afterlife, not on the one who denies it. His arguments, however, become more persuasive if they are understood as building on the initial agreement on the divinity of the sun and moon. He knows that Pāyāsi accepts some form of other world, even if he says otherwise, so the argument hinges on whether Pāyāsi’s methods are sufficient to <em>disprove</em> the kind of other world that Kassapa proposes, i.e. one driven by kamma.</span></span></span> there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>



<p id="dn23:8.1"><span class="parno">dn23:8.1</span>“Even though the worthy Kassapa says this, still I think that there is no afterlife.” </p>



<p id="dn23:8.3"><span class="parno">dn23:8.3</span>“Is there a method by which you can prove what you say?” </p>



<p id="dn23:8.5"><span class="parno">dn23:8.5</span>“There is, worthy Kassapa.” </p>



<p id="dn23:8.7"><span class="parno">dn23:8.7</span>“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>



<p id="dn23:8.8"><span class="parno">dn23:8.8</span>“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; who refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and are content, kind-hearted, with right view—when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’ They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is the method by which I prove that there is no afterlife.” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Simile of the Sewer </h4>



<p id="dn23:9.1"><span class="parno">dn23:9.1</span>“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there were a man sunk over his head in a sewer. Then you were to order someone to pull him out of the sewer, and they’d agree to do so. Then you’d tell them to carefully scrape the dung off that man’s body with bamboo scrapers, and they’d agree to do so. Then you’d tell them to carefully scrub that man’s body down with pale clay three times, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to smear that man’s body with oil, and carefully wash him down with fine paste three times, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to dress that man’s hair and beard, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to provide that man with costly garlands, makeup, and clothes, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to bring that man up to the stilt longhouse and set him up with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and they’d do so. </p>



<p id="dn23:9.25"><span class="parno">dn23:9.25</span>What do you think, chieftain? Now that man is nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, bedecked with garlands and bracelets, dressed in white, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation upstairs in the royal longhouse. Would he want to dive back into that sewer again?” </p>



<p id="dn23:9.27"><span class="parno">dn23:9.27</span>“No, worthy Kassapa. Why is that? Because that sewer is filthy, stinking, disgusting, and repulsive, and it’s regarded as such.” </p>



<p id="dn23:9.30"><span class="parno">dn23:9.30</span>“In the same way, chieftain, to the gods, human beings are filthy, stinking, disgusting, and repulsive, and are regarded as such. The smell of humans reaches the gods even a hundred leagues away.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Follow PTS reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">ubbāhati</i>. Cf. <a href="../an/an3.93.html#ubbāhati">AN3.93</a> for the sense “transport”.</span></span></span>
 What then of your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who are reborn in a higher realm after doing good things? Will they come back to tell you that there is an afterlife? By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>



<p id="dn23:10.1"><span class="parno">dn23:10.1</span>“Even though the worthy Kassapa says this, still I think that there is no afterlife.” </p>



<p id="dn23:10.3"><span class="parno">dn23:10.3</span>“Can you prove it?” </p>

<p id="dn23:10.6"><span class="parno">dn23:10.6</span>“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures and so on. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who refrain from killing living creatures and so on are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the thirty-three.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’ They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is how I prove that there is no afterlife.” </p>

<p id="dn23:11.1"><span class="parno">dn23:11.1</span>“Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. A hundred human years are equivalent to one day and night for the gods of the thirty-three. Thirty such days make a month, and twelve months make a year. The gods of the thirty-three have a lifespan of a thousand such years.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">36,000,000 years.</span></span></span> Now, as to your friends who are reborn in the company of the gods of the thirty-three after doing good things. If they think, ‘First I’ll amuse myself for two or three days, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Then I’ll go back to Pāyāsi and tell him that there is an afterlife.’ Would they come back to tell you that there is an afterlife?” </p>



<p id="dn23:11.9"><span class="parno">dn23:11.9</span>“No, worthy Kassapa.

<h4 class="subheading">2.5. Blind From Birth </h4>



<p id="dn23:11.16"><span class="parno">dn23:11.16</span>“Chieftain, suppose there was a person blind from birth. They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun. They’d say, ‘There’s no such thing as dark and bright sights, and no-one who sees them. There’s no such thing as blue, yellow, red, magenta, even and uneven ground, stars, moon and sun, and no-one who sees these things. I don’t know it or see it, therefore it doesn’t exist.’ Would they be speaking rightly?” </p>



<p id="dn23:11.28"><span class="parno">dn23:11.28</span>“No, worthy Kassapa. There are such things as dark and bright sights, and one who sees them. And those other things are real, too, as is the one who sees them. So it’s not right to say this: ‘I don’t know it or see it, therefore it doesn’t exist.’” </p>



<p id="dn23:11.36"><span class="parno">dn23:11.36</span>“In the same way, chieftain, when you tell me you don’t believe me you seem like the blind man in the simile. You can’t see the other world the way you think, with the eye of the flesh.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kassapa establishes the empirical method by which these truths are known. Science extends knowledge by means of external instruments, while meditation extends the scope of consciousness. A non-scientist cannot understand how a scientist establishes their conclusions, and can only rely on trust in the scientific establishment. Likewise a non-meditator cannot understand the capacity of expanded consciousness.</span></span></span> There are ascetics and brahmins who live in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, they purify the heavenly eye, the power of clairvoyance. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see this world and the other world, and sentient beings who are spontaneously reborn. That’s how to see the other world, not how you think, with the eye of the flesh. By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>

They mustn’t know that things are going to be better for them after death.

<p id="dn23:13.26"><span class="parno">dn23:13.26</span>So the brahmin lady took a knife, went to her bedroom, and sliced open her belly, thinking,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Read <i lang="pi" translate="no">opāṭesi</i>.</span></span></span> ‘Until I give birth—whether it’s a boy or a girl!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Prefer Mahāsaṅgīti reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">yāva vijāyāmi</i> over PTS <i lang="pi" translate="no">yāva jānāmi</i> (“until I know”); it echoes <i lang="pi" translate="no">yāva vijāyāmi</i> above.

Good ascetics and brahmins don’t force what is unripe to ripen; rather, they wait for it to ripen. For the life of clever ascetics and brahmins is beneficial. So long as they remain, good ascetics and brahmins produce much merit, and act for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.

But if you should extinguish it, here is the hatchet, the firewood, and the bundle of drill-sticks. Light the fire and serve it.’ And having instructed the boy, the ascetic went to the country. </p>



<p id="dn23:21.20"><span class="parno">dn23:21.20</span>But the boy was so engrossed in his play, the fire went out. He thought, ‘My father told me to serve the sacred flame. Why don’t I light it again and serve it?’ </p>

Now, that caravan had two leaders, each in charge of five hundred wagons. They thought, ‘This is a large caravan of a thousand wagons. Wherever we go we quickly use up the grass, wood, water, and the green foliage.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the places are not specified, the journey from “east to west” across desolate lands suggests they may have been venturing from the rich plains of the Ganges west across the Thar Desert of Rajasthan.</span></span></span>
 Why don’t we split the caravan in two halves?’ So that’s what they did. </p>



<p id="dn23:23.12"><span class="parno">dn23:23.12</span>One caravan leader, having prepared much grass, wood, and water, started the caravan. After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels. He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus, his clothes and hair all wet. Seeing him, he said,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Read with PTS <i lang="pi" translate="no">gadrabharathena</i> (“donkey cart”) for <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhadrena rathena</i> (“fine cart”).</span></span></span> ‘Sir, where do you come from?’ </p>

<p id="dn23:23.16"><span class="parno">dn23:23.16</span>‘And where are you going?’ </p>



<p id="dn23:23.17"><span class="parno">dn23:23.17</span>‘To the country named so and so.’ </p>



<p id="dn23:23.18"><span class="parno">dn23:23.18</span>‘But has there been much rain in the desert up ahead?’ </p>



<p id="dn23:23.19"><span class="parno">dn23:23.19</span>‘Indeed there has, sir. The paths are sprinkled with water, and there is much grass, wood, and water. Toss out your grass, wood, and water. Your wagons will move swiftly when lightly-laden, so don’t tire your draught teams.’ </p>



<p id="dn23:23.21"><span class="parno">dn23:23.21</span>So the caravan leader addressed his drivers, ‘This man says that there has been much rain in the desert up ahead. He advises us to toss out the grass, wood, and water. The wagons will move swiftly when lightly-laden, and won’t tire our draught teams. So let’s toss out the grass, wood, and water and restart the caravan with lightly-laden wagons.’ </p>



<p id="dn23:23.26"><span class="parno">dn23:23.26</span>‘Yes, worthy sir,’ the drivers replied, and that’s what they did. </p>



<p id="dn23:23.27"><span class="parno">dn23:23.27</span>But in the caravan’s first campsite they saw no grass, wood, or water. And in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh campsites they saw no grass, wood, or water. And all fell to ruin and disaster.

<p id="dn23:23.47"><span class="parno">dn23:23.47</span>So the caravan leader addressed his drivers, ‘This man says that there has been much rain in the desert up ahead.

<p id="dn23:23.54"><span class="parno">dn23:23.54</span>‘Yes, worthy sir,’ the drivers replied, and they restarted the caravan with the goods laden as before. </p>



<p id="dn23:23.55"><span class="parno">dn23:23.55</span>And in the caravan’s first campsite they saw no grass, wood, or water.

<p id="dn23:23.64"><span class="parno">dn23:23.64</span>So the caravan leader addressed his drivers, ‘This caravan came to ruin, as happens when guided by a foolish caravan leader.

<p id="dn23:23.67"><span class="parno">dn23:23.67</span>‘Yes, worthy sir’ replied the drivers, and that’s what they did. They crossed over the desert safely, as happens when guided by an astute caravan leader. </p>
