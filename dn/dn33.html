<p id="dn33:1.1.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse picks up from <a href="../dn/dn29.html#dn29:17.1">DN29:17.1</a>, where the Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more thorough list of the Buddha’s teachings. The Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the Sangītiparyāya.</span></span></span> There he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At <a href="../an/an10.176.html#content">AN10.176</a> Cunda asks about the purity of the western brahmins; at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:4.13.1">DN16:4.13.3</a> = <a href="../ud/ud8.5.html#content">Ud8.5</a> he offers the Buddha’s last meal; at <a href="../snp/snp1.5.html#content">Snp1.5</a> he asks about a true ascetic.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn33:1.2.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.2.1</span>Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the Sakyans <a href="../sn/sn35.243.html#content">SN35.243</a> and <a href="../mn/mn53.html#content">MN53</a>. Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha’s participation is a sign of his support for their civic and democratic process.</span></span></span> The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cunda’s mango grove. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>



<p id="dn33:1.3.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.3.1</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Mallas got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying, “Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>



<p id="dn33:1.4.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.4.1</span>Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. </p>



<p id="dn33:1.4.4"><span class="parno">dn33:1.4.4</span>The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, “The night is getting late, Vāseṭṭhas.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:5.19.1">DN16:5.19.1</a>, the Mallas are called Vāseṭṭhas after the family lineage of their priest (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>).</span></span></span> Please go at your convenience.” </p>



<p id="dn33:1.4.7"><span class="parno">dn33:1.4.7</span>“Yes, sir,” replied the Mallas. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. </p>



<p id="dn33:1.5.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.5.1</span>Soon after they left, the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta, “Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. My back is sore, I’ll stretch it.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha likewise mentions his bad back and invites another monk to teach in both the other suttas where he is first to teach in a new hall (<a href="../mn/mn53.html#soreback">MN53</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.243.html#soreback">SN35.243</a>), and also on the <i lang="pi" translate="no">uposatha</i> at Naḷakapāna (<a href="../an/an10.67.html#content">AN10.67</a>, <a href="../an/an10.68.html#content">AN10.68</a>). These were all occasions when the community was sitting late into the night.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn33:1.5.6"><span class="parno">dn33:1.5.6</span>“Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied. </p>



<p id="dn33:1.5.7"><span class="parno">dn33:1.5.7</span>And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn33:1.6.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.6.1</span>Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had recently passed away at Pāvā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../dn/dn29.html#dn29:1.1">DN29:1.3</a> and <a href="../mn/mn104.html#content">MN104</a>, in both of which the Buddha was in the Sakyan lands at this time. There, the news is conveyed to the Buddha by the novice Cunda. Perhaps he was confused with Cunda the smith.</span></span></span> With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words: “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” </p>



<p id="dn33:1.6.4"><span class="parno">dn33:1.6.4</span>You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics. And the Jain Ñātika’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge. </p>



<p id="dn33:1.7.1"><span class="parno">dn33:1.7.1</span>Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things. He went on to say, “That’s what happens, reverends, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. You should all recite this in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn33:1.7.7"><span class="parno">dn33:1.7.7</span>And what is that teaching? </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. Ones </h3>



<p id="dn33:1.7.10"><span class="parno">dn33:1.7.10</span>There are teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sāriputta adopts the “Aṅguttara principle” of arranging teachings by number rather than the “Saṁyutta principle” of arrangement by topic. Thus this list of teachings has more in common with the Aṅguttara Nikāya than with the Buddha’s original list of Saṁyutta topics. I note unusual or rare terms, but the references here are meant to be indicative rather than comprehensive.</span></span></span> You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>

<p id="dn33:1.8.4"><span class="parno">dn33:1.8.4</span>These are the teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The paucity of teachings of “one” reflects the fact that the Aṅguttara Nikāya Ones consists mostly of longer teachings that have been split into atoms to artificially create “ones”.</span></span></span> You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>

This is an example of an ambiguity between <i lang="pi" translate="no">vi + √muc</i> (“release”) and <i lang="pi" translate="no">adhi + √muc</i> (“resolve”) that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The subcommentary reads <i lang="pi" translate="no">vimuttaṁ</i> and offers two explanations: “‘Released’ (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vimuttaṁ</i>) means ‘resolved’ (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhimuttaṁ</i>); the meaning is slants, slopes, and inclines. Or else ‘released’ means ‘set free’ (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vissaṭṭhaṁ</i>).” Given that it is clearly accepted in the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult reading, it seems we must accept <i lang="pi" translate="no">vimuttaṁ</i> as the correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary, it has the same sense as <i lang="pi" translate="no">adhimutta</i>, namely, “resolved upon”.

Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.8"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.8</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and penetrating them theoretically. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.11"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.11</span>Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.14"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.14</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>

This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.20"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.20</span>Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.23"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.23</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.26"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.26</span>Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.29"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.29</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The pre-Buddhist sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sati</i> is “memory”, while “mindfulness” evolved from the practice of “remembering” scripture, creating an uninterrupted flow state in the present. In this sense, mindfulness can be understood as the element of continuity that knits consciousness together in a coherent stream. Thus when practicing “mindfulness of breathing” one pays continuous attention to the breaths, not “forgetting” what one is doing.</span></span></span> This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>



<p id="dn33:3.3.32"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.32</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is wise.

<p id="dn33:3.3.66"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.66</span>And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth?

<p id="dn33:3.3.69"><span class="parno">dn33:3.3.69</span>And how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path. That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching. </p>
