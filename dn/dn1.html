<h3 class="subheading">1. Talk on Wanderers </h3>
<p id="dn1:1.1"><span class="parno">dn1:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Tradition holds that these were the words spoken by Ānanda when reciting the Suttapiṭaka at the First Council following the Buddha’s death. In fact it is a tag signifying that the text has been passed down through oral tradition and the speaker was not present at the events (<a href="./dn5.html#soIhaveheard">DN 5.74</a>, <a href="../mn/mn127.html#oughttobe">MN127.19</a>). <br> This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his <em>The All-Embracing Net of Views</em>.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">By convention, suttas do not specify the date, so we have scant internal chronology. 	<br> Walk about fifteen kilometers north from Rājagaha (modern Rajgir) to reach Nāḷandā. 	<br> “Mendicant” is a literal translation of <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhu</i>, one who goes for alms.</span></span></span> The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his resident pupil, the student Brahmadatta.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A “wanderer” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paribbājaka</i>) was a homeless religious renunciate—male or female—who wandered seeking alms. Kauṭilya describes their lifestyle as “mastery of the senses, abstaining from ritual activities, living without possessions, abandoning attachments, practicing mendicancy, residing in the wilderness but not in a single place, and purifying himself internally and externally” (Arthaśāstra 1.3.12, Olivelle’s translation). <br> “Resident pupil” (or elsewhere just “pupil”) is <i lang="pi" translate="no">antevāsi</i>, a live-in apprentice of a master.	<br> “Student” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">māṇava</i>) is a young man who was learning the Vedas from a master.</span></span></span> Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Today these are called the Triple Gem that makes up the Buddhist religion; however they are not known by that term in the early texts.</span></span></span> but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the disagreement of student and teacher signifies their confusion, it also represents the diversity of views within the brahmanical caste and the openness with which a student could disagree with their teacher.</span></span></span> And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. </p>


<hr>

<a id="judgmentalism"></a>
<p id="dn1:2.1"><span class="parno">dn1:2.1</span>Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ambalaṭṭhikā means “place of mango saplings”. It was a rest-house set up by the king of Rājagaha about a day’s journey from the capital. It must have been sizable.</span></span></span> And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. And so both tutor and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. </p>

<hr>

<p id="dn1:3.1"><span class="parno">dn1:3.1</span>Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of judgmentalism came up:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Saṅkhiyadhamma</i> is a unique term. The commentary glosses it as <i lang="pi" translate="no">kathādhamma</i>, following which it has been translated as “conversation” or “trend of conversation”. But <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhā</i> means “appraisal, assessment, evaluation, measuring, calculating”, and here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties assess or judge the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. Compare the “appraisal” of the Buddha at <a href="./dn19.html#appraised">DN19.30</a>.</span></span></span></p>
<p id="dn1:3.2"><span class="parno">dn1:3.2</span>“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse convictions of sentient beings have been well deciphered by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Adhimutti</i> is something that has been decided, a conviction or belief.</span></span></span> For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. And so both tutor and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="dn1:4.1"><span class="parno">dn1:4.1</span>When the Buddha found out about this discussion on judgmentalism among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This would have been an open air pavilion in the rest-house. By convention, when a teacher or other respected person is to sit, a sitting mat is spread out or made ready for them.</span></span></span> “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”</p>
<p id="dn1:4.3"><span class="parno">dn1:4.3</span>The mendicants told him what had happened, adding,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The very first words of the Buddha in the Suttapiṭaka: he asks to hear what others are saying.</span></span></span>Here and in similar passages the Pali repeats all and I abbreviate. “This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="dn1:5.1"><span class="parno">dn1:5.1</span>“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific. They “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. judging others). Compare <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN 22</a>, where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral <i lang="pi" translate="no">hoti</i>, while for the mendicants it uses <i lang="pi" translate="no">karaṇīya</i>, as here.</span></span></span> You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Complaining about others does not hurt them, only the one who gets upset.</span></span></span> If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Equanimity is a prerequisite for evaluating facts.</span></span></span></p>
<p id="dn1:5.4"><span class="parno">dn1:5.4</span>“No, sir.” </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn1:6.1"><span class="parno">dn1:6.1</span>“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ </p>
<p id="dn1:6.3"><span class="parno">dn1:6.3</span>If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: ‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Ethics </h3>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics </h4>
<p id="dn1:7.1"><span class="parno">dn1:7.1</span>When an ordinary person speaks praise of the Realized One, they speak only of trivial, trifling details of mere ethics.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ethics (or morality or virtue, <i lang="pi" translate="no">sīla</i>) is important, but it pales in comparison with the higher dimensions of the Buddha’s path. For an example of this kind of praise see <a href="../mn/mn77.html#5qualities">MN77.10</a>. 	<br> The Buddha often referred to himself as “the Realized One” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tathāgata</i>).</span></span></span> And what are the trivial, trifling details of mere ethics that an ordinary person speaks of?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha lays out in detail the ethical conduct for mendicant followers.</span></span></span></p>
<p id="dn1:8.1"><span class="parno">dn1:8.1</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up killing living creatures. He has renounced the rod and the sword. He’s scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. <br> The Buddha is called “the ascetic Gotama” by non-Buddhists.</span></span></span> Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An “ordinary person” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">puthujjana</i>) is anyone who has not, at minimum, entered the path to stream-entry.</span></span></span></p>
<p id="dn1:8.3"><span class="parno">dn1:8.3</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up stealing. He takes only what’s given, and expects only what’s given. He keeps himself clean by not thieving.’ Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn1:8.5"><span class="parno">dn1:8.5</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up unchastity. He is chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Chastity” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmacariya</i>, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.</span></span></span> Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn1:9.1"><span class="parno">dn1:9.1</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up lying. He speaks the truth and sticks to the truth. He’s honest and dependable, and doesn’t trick the world with his words.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the first of the four kinds of right speech. Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precepts on speech enjoin a positive and constructive use of speech.</span></span></span> Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn1:9.3"><span class="parno">dn1:9.3</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up divisive speech. He doesn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciles those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Harmony” (or “unanimity”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">samagga</i>) does not excuse untrue, bigoted, or otherwise harmful speech. True harmony is only achieved in the presence of the Dhamma.</span></span></span> Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn1:9.5"><span class="parno">dn1:9.5</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up harsh speech. He speaks in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.’ Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn1:9.7"><span class="parno">dn1:9.7</span>‘The ascetic Gotama has given up talking nonsense. His words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He says things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Attha</i> is a polyvalent term, here taking the senses  “meaningful” and “beneficial”. Elsewhere it means “goal”, “need”, “purpose”, “lawsuit”, or “ending”, and the senses are not always easy to untangle.</span></span></span> Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>

<hr>

<p id="dn1:10.1"><span class="parno">dn1:10.1</span>‘The ascetic Gotama refrains from injuring plants and seeds.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Buddhists generally do not regard plants as sentient, but value them as part of the ecosystem that supports all life.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn1:10.3"><span class="parno">dn1:10.3</span>‘He eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">From <a href="../mn/mn66.html#wrongtime">MN66</a> and <a href="../mn/mn70.html#wrongtime">MN70</a> we can see that “at night” means after dark, while “at the wrong time” means in the afternoon. More explicitly, these are the “wrong time at night” and the “wrong time in the day”, in which case they are both the “wrong time”.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn1:10.4"><span class="parno">dn1:10.4</span>‘He refrains from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music .’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Such sensual entertainments distract and excite the mind. This and the next three precepts encourage peace of mind for meditation.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn1:10.5"><span class="parno">dn1:10.5</span>‘He refrains from attiring and adorning himself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This was ignored by the Buddha’s cousin, Nanda (<a href="../sn/sn21.8.html#1.2">SN 21.8:1.2</a>).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn1:10.6"><span class="parno">dn1:10.6</span>‘He refrains from high and luxurious beds.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">To avoid sleeping too much.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn1:10.7"><span class="parno">dn1:10.7</span>‘He refrains from receiving gold and currency,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Literally “gold and silver” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jātarūparajata</i>), but <i lang="pi" translate="no">rajata</i> is explained in <a href="../vi/bu-vb-np18.html#content">Bhikku's Nissaggiya Pācittiya 18</a> as currency of any kind.</span></span></span> raw grains,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mendicants receive only the day’s meal and do not store or cook food.</span></span></span> raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status.</span></span></span> goats and sheep,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are animals raised for food.</span></span></span> chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Land for a monastery may be accepted by the Saṅgha as a community, but not by individual mendicants.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>

<p id="dn1:10.16"><span class="parno">dn1:10.16</span>‘He refrains from running errands and messages;<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These items are discussed in detail below. | Acting as a go-between for lay business was tempting due to the mendicants’ wandering lifestyle. However, it exposes them to risk if the message is not delivered or if it is bad news.</span></span></span> buying and selling;<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For example, trading in monastery property.</span></span></span> falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.’ Such is an ordinary person’s praise of the Realized One. </p>

<h4 class="subheading">3.1. Theories About the Past </h4>

<p id="dn1:28.1"><span class="parno">dn1:28.1</span>There are other principles—deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute—which the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight. Those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these things.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">One meaning of <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i> is “principle” in the sense of a natural law as well as a moral value. <br> Here begins the famous exposition of the sixty-two views. The subtlety of the analysis lies in how, rather than refuting the details of the views, the Buddha traces them all back to their fundamental psychology.</span></span></span> And what are these principles? </p>
<p id="dn1:29.1"><span class="parno">dn1:29.1</span>There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and assert various hypotheses concerning the past on eighteen grounds. And what are the eighteen grounds on which they rely? </p>
<h5 class="subheading">3.1.1. Eternalism </h5>
<p id="dn1:30.1"><span class="parno">dn1:30.1</span>There are some ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In such contexts, the “self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">attā</i>) is a postulated metaphysical entity rather than a simple psychological sense of personal identity. The nature of this “self” or “soul” was endlessly debated. The Buddha rejected all theories of a “self”, and elsewhere it is said that “identity view” underlies all sixty-two views of the Brahmajāla (<a href="../sn/sn41.3.html#views">SN 41.3</a>). 	<br> The “cosmos” is the <i lang="pi" translate="no">loka</i>, otherwise translated as “world”. This sometimes refers to the simple physical realm, sometimes to the world of experience, or else, as here, the vast universe as conceived in ancient Indian thought.</span></span></span> And what are the four grounds on which they rely? </p>
<p id="dn1:31.1"><span class="parno">dn1:31.1</span>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Immersion” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>) is deep meditative stillness. The word conveys the sense of “gathered”, “collected”, with a secondary sense of “ignited”, “illuminated”. The practice of <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i> (or <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, “absorption”) has never been regarded as uniquely Buddhist. However, right meditation begins with right view. Since these meditators begin with wrong view, their <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i> is “wrong” because it merely reinforces their error.</span></span></span> That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The recollection of past lives is specific, detailed, and confident as it is based on the clear mind of deep immersion.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn1:31.3"><span class="parno">dn1:31.3</span>They say: ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the Upaniṣadic view of the eternal <i lang="pi" translate="no">ātman</i> that is the immanent soul of the world or cosmos, <i lang="pi" translate="no">loka</i>. Elsewhere in the suttas such theorists assert that the self and the cosmos are identical (<a href="sn/sn24.3.html#">SN 24.3:1.3</a>: <i lang="pi" translate="no">so attā so loko</i>).</span></span></span> They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The eternal “self” is contrasted with the ephemeral lives of beings. | The famous word <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁsara</i> is often understood as a “cycle” of rebirths, but the meaning is, rather, to “wander on” or “transmigrate”. <br> For the phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">sassatisamaṁ</i> (“lasting forever and ever”), compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.10.1: “He reaches that world free of sorrow and snow, where he lives forever and ever” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sa lokam āgacchaty aśokam ahimam <br> tasmin vasati śāśvatīḥ samāḥ</i>).</span></span></span> Why is that?

<hr>

<p id="dn1:32.1"><span class="parno">dn1:32.1</span>And what is the second ground on which they rely? </p>

<p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. That is: one eon of the cosmos contracting and expanding; two, three, four, five, or ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This differs only in the length of time, which is now up to ten eons. A single eon (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kappa</i>) lasts longer than it would take to wear away a huge mountain by stroking it with a cloth once a century <a href="../sn/sn15.5.html">SN 15.5</a>, while the number of eons is greater than the sands in the Ganges river <a href="../sn/sn15.8.html">SN 15.8</a>. The vast time periods envisaged in early Buddhist texts are comparable with those of modern cosmology in physics.</span></span></span></p>
<p id="dn1:32.4"><span class="parno">dn1:32.4</span>They say: ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.

<p>It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. That is: ten eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding; twenty, thirty, or forty eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

<h5 class="subheading">3.2.5. Extinguishment of Suffering in This Life </h5>

<p id="dn1:3.19.1"><span class="parno">dn1:3.19.1</span>There are some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in this life. They assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life on five grounds.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These five theories argue for the extinguishment of suffering through the experience of pleasure in the present life. The Buddha taught extinguishment (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i>) in this very life, but not “of an existing being” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sato sattassa</i>) or “self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">attā</i>). The Buddha denied that there is such a thing, pointing out that we are a stream of ever-changing conditions, fueled by desire and attachment, and liable to suffering. With the end of craving there is no fuel to sustain the stream, so suffering comes to an end. 	<br> It is unclear why these views of the “present life” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭhadhamma</i>) are classified under views of the future; see <a href="../mn/mn102.html#content">MN102.1</a>.</span></span></span> And what are the five grounds on which they rely? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn1:3.20.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘When this self amuses itself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, that’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The hedonist.</span></span></span> That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn1:3.21.1">But someone else says to them: ‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life. Why is that? Because sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we see the philosophical reasoning that prompts the evolution of more refined conceptions of self.</span></span></span> Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, this self enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “absorptions” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>) are central to Buddhist meditation. The Buddha did say that they can be considered “extinguishment in the present life” in a qualified sense (<a href="../an/9.51.html">AN 9.51</a>). As we have seen above, however, if they are undertaken with wrong view, the experience itself will tend to reinforce the attachment to a self.</span></span></span> That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn1:3.22.1">But someone else says to them: ‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The theorist has an experience of a deeper state of meditation, so they know that the first <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> cannot be the ultimate.</span></span></span> Why is that? Because the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarse.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Jhānas</i> are subtle states of refined consciousness in which nothing is coarse when compared to ordinary consciousness. Within each state, however, certain mental factors are coarse relative to others. A meditator proceeds through the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> with the successive stilling of the relatively coarser factors in each state.</span></span></span> But when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, this self enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’ That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn1:3.23.1">But someone else says to them: ‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life. Why is that? Because the rapture and emotional elation there are coarse. But with the fading away of rapture, this self enters and remains in the third absorption, where it meditates with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”. That’s how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life.’ That is how some assert ultimate extinguishment for an existing being in this life. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn1:3.24.1">But someone else says to them: ‘<em>That</em> self of which you speak does exist, I don’t deny it. But that’s not how <em>this</em> self attains ultimate extinguishment in this life. Why is that? Because the mental partaking of that as ‘blissful’ is said to be coarse.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Ābhoga</i> (“partaking”) is unique in the early texts in this sense. The commentary says that after emerging from <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, one repeatedly partakes and attends to that bliss (for <i lang="pi" translate="no">ābhoga</i> with <i lang="pi" translate="no">manasikāra</i>, see The Questions of King Milanda 5.1.1. Compare Patañjalī’s commentary on Yogasūtra 1.17: “<i lang="pi" translate="no">vitarka</i> is the gross (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sthula</i>) partaking in the mental object, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vicāra</i> is subtle”.</span></span></span> But with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
