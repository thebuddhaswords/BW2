<p id="dn19:4.1"><span class="parno">dn19:4.1</span>Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed them, ‘Gentlemen, would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the Buddha?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For “genuine praise” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yathābhucce vaṇṇe</i>), see <a href="../dn/dn1.html#yathābhucce">DN1</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn19:4.4"><span class="parno">dn19:4.4</span>Then Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the Buddha:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This set of eight is not found elsewhere. <br> “Proffered” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">payirudāhāsi</i>, a unique term in early texts.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn19:5.1"><span class="parno">dn19:5.1</span>‘What do the good gods of the thirty-three think?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sakka adopts the same rhetorical style as Sanaṅkumāra (<a href="../dn/dn18.html#Sanaṅkumāra">DN18</a>).</span></span></span> How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans! I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has such sympathy for the world, apart from the Buddha. </p>

<a id="skillful"></a>

<p id="dn19:6.1"><span class="parno">dn19:6.1</span>Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:7.1"><span class="parno">dn19:7.1</span>Also, the Buddha has well described what is skillful and what is unskillful,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare <a href="../dn/dn18.html#skillfull">DN18</a>.</span></span></span> what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes all these things, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:8.1"><span class="parno">dn19:8.1</span>Also, the Buddha has well described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment converges with the practice,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Paṭipadā</i> is instrumental.</span></span></span> as the waters of the Ganges come together and converge with the waters of the Yamuna.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I don’t think this idea is found elsewhere in quite this way. Normally it is said that the path leads to Nibbāna like the rivers lead to the ocean (eg. <a href="../sn/sn45.114.html#content">SN45.114</a>).</span></span></span> I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:9.1"><span class="parno">dn19:9.1</span>Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much that you’d think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his food free of vanity.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This item is unique.</span></span></span> I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:10.1"><span class="parno">dn19:10.1</span>Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their journey.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Another unique item.</span></span></span> The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but doesn’t send them away.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is normally true, but in some cases the Buddha left a badly-behaved community e.g <a href="../mn/mn48.html#content">MN48</a> and expanded in <a href="../vi/kd10.html#content">Khandhaka 10</a>), dismissed misbehaving monks (eg. <a href="../an/an8.10.html#content">AN8.10</a>), or even dismissed a large community (<a href="../mn/mn67.html#content">MN67</a>). <br> The “joy of solitude” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">ekārāmataṁ </i>.</span></span></span> I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:11.1"><span class="parno">dn19:11.1</span>Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as he says, and says as he does.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../dn/dn29.html#honest">DN29</a>, <a href="../an/an4.23.html#honest">AN4.23</a>, and <a href="../it/it.html#honest">Itivuttaka 112</a>.</span></span></span> I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn19:12.1"><span class="parno">dn19:12.1</span>Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pariyositasaṅkappo</i> (“achieved all he wished for”) is a synonym of the more common <i lang="pi" translate="no">paripuṇṇasaṅkappo</i> (eg. <a href="../mn/mn29.html#content">MN29</a>).</span></span></span> I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has achieved these things, apart from the Buddha.’ </p>



<p id="dn19:12.3"><span class="parno">dn19:12.3</span>These are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by Sakka. Hearing them, the gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn19:13.1"><span class="parno">dn19:13.1</span>Then some gods thought, ‘If only four fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn19:13.4"><span class="parno">dn19:13.4</span>Other gods thought, ‘Let alone four fully awakened Buddhas; if only three fully awakened Buddhas, or two fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>



<p id="dn19:14.1"><span class="parno">dn19:14.1</span>When they said this, Sakka said, ‘It is impossible, gentlemen, for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This impossibility is also at <a href="../an/an1.277.html#content">AN1.277</a> and <a href="../mn/mn115.html#impossible">MN115</a>. <br> “In one solar system” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ekissā lokadhātuyā</i>): a single <i lang="pi" translate="no">lokadhātu</i> encompasses a single terrestrial world with a single moon and sun.</span></span></span> May that Blessed One be healthy and well, and remain with us for a long time!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is not common to wish for the Buddha’s long life, but we do find this sentiment expressed in a conversation between Sāriputta and Ānanda (<a href="../sn/sn21.2.html#content">SN21</a>).</span></span></span> That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>



<p id="dn19:14.5"><span class="parno">dn19:14.5</span>Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice, advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject. Each one, having been advised, stood at his own seat without leaving. </p>



<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="dn19:14.7"><span class="parno">dn19:14.7</span>
The Kings were instructed, <br/>
and heeded good advice. <br/>
With clear and peaceful minds, <br/>
they stood by their own seats. </p>
</div>

<hr>



<p id="dn19:15.1"><span class="parno">dn19:15.1</span>Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three, ‘As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—the Divinity will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’ </p>



<hr>

<div class="verse">
		<p id="dn19:15.5"><span class="parno">dn19:15.5</span>
		As indicated by the signs, <br/>

		For this is the sign of the Divinity: <br/>

<h3 class="subheading">3. On Sanaṅkumāra </h3>
<a id="appearance"></a>

<p id="dn19:16.1"><span class="parno">dn19:16.1</span>Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying, ‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ And the four great kings did likewise. Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison, ‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ </p>



<p id="dn19:16.7"><span class="parno">dn19:16.7</span>When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form. For a Divinity’s normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range of the gods of the thirty-three. When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, as a golden statue outshines the human form. </p>

<p>When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat. They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking, ‘Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.’ </p>

<p>And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, like a king on the day of his coronation. </p>



<p id="dn19:17.3"><span class="parno">dn19:17.3</span>Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses: </p>

<p id="dn19:29.1"><span class="parno">dn19:29.1</span>Once upon a time, there was a king named Disampati.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Disampati means “head of the directions”, i.e. king of all the land. He and his story are found nowhere else in the early texts.</span></span></span> He had a brahmin high priest named the Steward.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Steward” is Govinda, literally “lord of cows”. The “high priest” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>) was a hereditary office, a learned ritualist and adviser attached to a specific family.

The closeness of the role is shown in that aristocratic families could be referred to by the lineage of the high priest.</span></span></span> Disampati’s son was the prince named Reṇu,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the current sutta does not explicitly identify their realm, Dīpavaṁsa iii 40 records Disampati and Reṇu as kings of Kāsi.

Despite the popularity of the name in Pali, it does not seem to appear in Sanskrit sources.

<p id="dn19:29.6"><span class="parno">dn19:29.6</span>In due course the brahmin Steward passed away.
