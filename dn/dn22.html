<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">

<p id="dn22:1.1"><span class="parno">dn22:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse is copied from <a href="../mn/mn10.html#content">MN10</a>. The section on the four noble truths has been expanded with material mostly drawn from <a href="../mn/mn141.html#content">MN141</a>. These discourses are the most influential texts for modern Theravada meditation, prompting countless modern commentaries. Comparative study of the several parallel versions reveals that this discourse, while comprised almost entirely of early material, was compiled in this form as one of the latest texts in the Pali suttas. <br> While mindfulness is always useful (<a href="../sn/sn46.53.html#content">SN46.53</a>), the “establishment of mindfulness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i>) refers especially to a conscious development of contemplative practices based on mindfulness, i.e. “mindfulness meditation”.</span></span></span></span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>



<p id="dn22:1.5"><span class="parno">dn22:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>



<p id="dn22:1.7"><span class="parno">dn22:1.7</span>“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">ekāyano maggo</i> (“path to convergence”) is given multiple meanings in commentaries and ancient translations. Outside of <i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i>, it is used in only one context in Pali, where it means to “come together with” (<a href="../mn/mn12.html#mindfulness">MN12</a>). At <a href="../sn/sn47.18.html#content">SN47.18</a> the phrase is spoken by Brahmā, which suggests it was a Brahmanical term. At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11—a passage full of details shared with the suttas—it means a place where things unite or converge. Thus <i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> leads to everything “coming together as one”. In other words, as seventh factor of the noble eightfold path, it leads to <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>, the eighth factor (<a href="../sn/sn45.1.html#">SN45.1</a>; see also <a href="../mn/mn44.html#">MN44</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:1.8"><span class="parno">dn22:1.8</span>What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāye kāyānupassī</i>, literally “observes a body in the body” refers to focusing on a specific aspect of embodied experience, such as the breath, the postures, etc. <br> “Keen” (or “ardent”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">ātāpī</i>) implies effort, while “aware” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sampajāno</i>) is the wisdom of understanding situation and context. <br> “Covetousness and displeasure” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhijjhādomanassaṁ</i>) are the strong forms of desire and aversion that are overcome by sense restraint in preparation for meditation.</span></span></span> They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Feelings” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vedanā</i>) are the basic tones of pleasant, painful, or neutral, not the complexes we call “emotions”.</span></span></span> They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Mind” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">citta</i>) is simple awareness. In meditation contexts, “mind” is often similar in meaning to <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>.</span></span></span> They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Principles” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhammā</i>) are the natural “systems” of cause and effect that underlie the “teachings”. The renderings “mind objects” or “mental qualities” are incorrect, as many of the things spoken of in this section are neither mind objects nor mental qualities. “Phenomena” is a possible translation, but the emphasis is not on the “appearance” of things, but on the “principles” governing their conditional relations.</span></span></span></p>


<h3>1. Observing the Body </h3>

<p><strong>1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing </strong></p>

<hr>

<p id="dn22:2.1"><span class="parno">dn22:2.1</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body? </p>



<p id="dn22:2.2"><span class="parno">dn22:2.2</span>It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The context here—a mendicant gone to the forest—establishes that this practice takes place in the wider context of the Gradual Training. Indeed, this whole sutta can be understood as an expansion of this phrase, mentioned briefly at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:67.1">DN2</a>.</span></span></span> Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The most fundamental meditation instruction in Buddhism. Notice how the Buddha phrases it: not “concentrate on the breath” as an object, but rather “breathing” as an activity to which one brings mindfulness.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:2.4"><span class="parno">dn22:2.4</span>Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The stages of breath meditation are not meant to be done deliberately, but to be observed and understood as the natural process of deepening meditation. When starting out, the breath is somewhat rough and coarse.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:2.5"><span class="parno">dn22:2.5</span>When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Over time, the breath becomes more subtle and soft.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:2.6"><span class="parno">dn22:2.6</span>They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Contextually the idiom “whole body” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sabbakāya</i>) here refers to the breath, marking the fuller and more continuous awareness that arises with tranquility. Some practitioners, however, interpret it as the “whole physical body”, broadening awareness to encompass the movement and settling of energies throughout the body.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:2.7"><span class="parno">dn22:2.7</span>They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “physical process” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kāyasaṅkhāraṁ</i>) is the breath (<a href="../sn/sn41.6.html#breathing">SN41.6</a>).</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:2.8"><span class="parno">dn22:2.8</span>It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Text has “long” and “short”, but “deep” and “shallow” or “heavy” and “light” are more idiomatic for describing the breath in English.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:2.11"><span class="parno">dn22:2.11</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Internally” is one’s own body, “externally” the bodies of others, or external physical phenomena. This distinction is applied broadly in Buddhist meditation, but it is more relevant in some contexts than others. In the case of the breath, one is focusing on one’s own breath, but when contemplating, say, a dead body, or the material elements, there is more of an external dimension. Starting with “me” in here and the “world” out there, this practice dissolves this distinction so that we see we are of the same nature as everything else.</span></span></span> They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the <i lang="pi" translate="no">vipassanā</i> (“insight” or “discernment”) dimension of meditation, observing not just the rise and fall of phenomena, but also their conditioned “nature” as being “liable” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">-dhamma</i>) to impermanence. The meaning of this passage is explained at (<a href="../sn/sn47.42.html#content">SN47.42</a>). Apart from these passages, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vipassanā</i> in <i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> pertains specially to the observation of principles.</span></span></span> Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mindfulness meditation leads to a range of knowledges as detailed by Anuruddha at <a href="../sn/sn52.6.html#content">SN52.6</a> and <a href="../sn/sn52.11.html#content">SN52.11</a>–24. An arahant is “independent” of any attachment (eg. <a href="../mn/mn143.html#content">MN143</a>), but <i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> is also taught to give up dependency on views of the past and future (<a href="../dn/dn29.html#40.1">DN 29:40.1</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:2.14"><span class="parno">dn22:2.14</span>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.2. The Postures </h4>



<p id="dn22:3.1"><span class="parno">dn22:3.1</span>Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In early Pali, this practice is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the closely related Kāyagatāsatisutta (<a href="../mn/mn119.html#content">MN119</a>). It is practiced by developing a reflexive awareness of one’s posture and activity as it proceeds, often assisted by moving slowly and carefully.</span></span></span> Whatever posture their body is in, they know it. </p>



<p id="dn22:3.3"><span class="parno">dn22:3.3</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to fall, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. </p>



<p id="dn22:3.6"><span class="parno">dn22:3.6</span>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.3. Situational Awareness </h4>



<p id="dn22:4.1"><span class="parno">dn22:4.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Situational awareness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sampajañña</i>) understands the context and purpose of activities. The main examples here illustrate the activities of daily monastic life: leaving the monastery on almsround, restraint while in the town, care wearing the robes, then mindfully eating and going to the toilet.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:4.2"><span class="parno">dn22:4.2</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:4.3"><span class="parno">dn22:4.3</span>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive </h4>



<p id="dn22:5.1"><span class="parno">dn22:5.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This practice is intended to counter sexual desire and obsession. The primary focus is on one’s own body, rather than another’s body, although that can be brought in also. By focusing on aspects of our body that we normally prefer to ignore, we move towards a healthy sense of acceptance and neutrality towards our body.</span></span></span> ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Thirty-one parts are mentioned in early texts, later expanded to thirty-two with the addition of the “brain” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">matthaluṅga</i>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn22:5.3"><span class="parno">dn22:5.3</span>It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And a person with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “bag with openings at both ends” is the body. Not all the varieties of grains and beans can be positively identified.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:5.6"><span class="parno">dn22:5.6</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:5.7"><span class="parno">dn22:5.7</span>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.5. Focusing on the Elements </h4>



<p id="dn22:6.1"><span class="parno">dn22:6.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While meditation on the elements is commonly taught in early texts, this phrase is found only in the two Satipaṭṭhānasuttas and the Kāyagatāsatisutta. Detailed instructions are found in such suttas as <a href="../mn/mn28.html#content">MN28</a> and <a href="../mn/mn140.html#content">MN140</a>. This meditation works in any posture, whereas breath meditation is best done sitting, to allow the breath to become still.</span></span></span> ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “elements” are the four states of matter as represented by their primary material example and their dominant property: earth as a solid with the property of resisting or upholding; water as a liquid with the property of binding; air as a gas with the property of movement; and fire (“heat” or “energy”) as plasma with the property of transformation.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:6.3"><span class="parno">dn22:6.3</span>It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This gruesome image shows that butchery of cows was a normal feature of ancient Indian life.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:6.6"><span class="parno">dn22:6.6</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn22:6.7"><span class="parno">dn22:6.7</span>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations </h4>

The division from these, the disconnection, segregation, and parting from them:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Piya</i> often refers to those who are dear and beloved, but as shown here it can also mean simply anything that is liked.</span></span></span> this is what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’. </p>

<p id="dn22:21.16"><span class="parno">dn22:21.16</span>And what is right livelihood?

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.

<p id="dn22:21.31"><span class="parno">dn22:21.31</span>And what is right immersion? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion. </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn22:21.38"><span class="parno">dn22:21.38</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
