<h3>1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā </h3>

<p id="dn4:1.1"><span class="parno">dn4:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta shows how the conversion of Pokkharasāti in <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:2.22.1">DN3</a> affected the brahmins as far away as Campā.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campā,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Campā is modern Champapuri near Bhagalpur in Bihar state, not far from West Bengal. It is near the eastern-most reach of the Buddha’s journeys. Campā was the capital of Aṅga, one of the sixteen “great nations” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahājanapadā</i>). It was a flourishing trade center at which Northern Black Polished Ware has been found, and became a sacred city for the Jains.</span></span></span> where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Gaggarā</i>, an onomatopoeic reduplication (“gargle”), is the name of a number of rivers and whirlpools in Sanskrit (cp. the modern Ghaggar River in north-west India).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:1.4"><span class="parno">dn4:1.4</span>Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we see how the endowment of <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmadeyya</i> helped the king of Magadha establish his influence over the Aṅgas.</span></span></span></p>



<hr>

<p id="dn4:2.1"><span class="parno">dn4:2.1</span>The brahmins and householders of Campā heard:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Householders” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">gahapati</i>) is literal; it means land owners. Thus the “brahmins and householders” (not “brahmin householders”) were the wealthy class.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:2.2"><span class="parno">dn4:2.2</span>“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, exiting Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. </p>



<p id="dn4:3.1"><span class="parno">dn4:3.1</span>Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond, and addressed his butler, “My butler, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the Gaggarā Lotus Pond?” </p>



<p id="dn4:3.5"><span class="parno">dn4:3.5</span>“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They’re going to see that worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn4:3.9"><span class="parno">dn4:3.9</span>“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:3.12"><span class="parno">dn4:3.12</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied the butler, and did as he was asked. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa </h3>



<p id="dn4:4.1"><span class="parno">dn4:4.1</span>Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Campā on some business. They heard that the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama. They approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him, “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” </p>



<p id="dn4:4.6"><span class="parno">dn4:4.6</span>“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn4:5.1"><span class="parno">dn4:5.1</span>“Please don’t, worthy Soṇadaṇḍa! It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Both the repetition below and the parallel at <a href="../mn/mn95.html#visit">MN95</a> include the phrase “it’s appropriate that he comes to see you”. It may have been omitted here by mistake.</span></span></span> For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>



<p id="dn4:5.6"><span class="parno">dn4:5.6</span>You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Jātivāda</i> is sometimes translated as “doctrine of birth”, but the context here shows this cannot be the case. It refers to the genealogical records of the family lineage.</span></span></span> For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>



<p id="dn4:5.9"><span class="parno">dn4:5.9</span>You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:5.10"><span class="parno">dn4:5.10</span>You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. You know them word-by-word, and their grammar. You are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … </p>



<p id="dn4:5.11"><span class="parno">dn4:5.11</span>You are attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. You have divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Brahmavarcasa</i> (“divine lustre”) commonly describes a spiritual or ethereal beauty due to ritual (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.1.9, 2.3.1, 4.1.1), or simply the healthy glow from time in the sun, which if overdone leads to sunburn (eg. Taittirīya Saṁhita 2.10.2). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Brahmavarṇa</i> (“divine looks”), on the other hand, seems unknown in the Vedic tradition. <br> For Mahāsaṅgīti <i lang="pi" translate="no">vacchasī</i> read <i lang="pi" translate="no">vaccasī</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">varcasin</i>), “possessing lustre”.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:5.12"><span class="parno">dn4:5.12</span>You are ethical, mature in ethical conduct. … </p>



<p id="dn4:5.13"><span class="parno">dn4:5.13</span>You’re a good speaker who enunciates well, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … </p>



<p id="dn4:5.14"><span class="parno">dn4:5.14</span>You tutor the tutors of many, and teach three hundred young students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Notice that the royal endowment was not just for a luxury residence, it was the site of a major international college. Kings invested in education.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:5.15"><span class="parno">dn4:5.15</span>You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. … </p>



<p id="dn4:5.17"><span class="parno">dn4:5.17</span>You’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … </p>



<p id="dn4:5.18"><span class="parno">dn4:5.18</span>and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:5.19"><span class="parno">dn4:5.19</span>You live in Campā, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. The Qualities of the Buddha </h3>



<p id="dn4:6.1"><span class="parno">dn4:6.1</span>When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins: </p>



<p id="dn4:6.2"><span class="parno">dn4:6.2</span>“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama, and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me. He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me; rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:6.7"><span class="parno">dn4:6.7</span>When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. … </p>



<p id="dn4:6.8"><span class="parno">dn4:6.8</span>When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold, both coined and uncoined, stored above and below ground. … </p>



<p id="dn4:6.9"><span class="parno">dn4:6.9</span>He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. … </p>



<p id="dn4:6.10"><span class="parno">dn4:6.10</span>Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Later tradition says that the young Siddhattha sneaked out of his home to avoid creating such a scene, but the early texts say he left despite his parents’ weeping.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:6.11"><span class="parno">dn4:6.11</span>He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He has divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. … </p>



<p id="dn4:6.12"><span class="parno">dn4:6.12</span>He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. … </p>

For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for the worthy Gotama to come to see me; rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. This is the extent of the worthy Gotama’s praise that I have memorized. But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of the worthy Gotama is limitless.” </p>



<p id="dn4:6.45"><span class="parno">dn4:6.45</span>When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “According to Soṇadaṇḍa’s praises, if the worthy Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a knapsack.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Knapsack” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">puṭosa</i>, where <i lang="pi" translate="no">puṭa</i> is “bag” and <i lang="pi" translate="no">osa</i> is “food” (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">avasa</i>). The compound is a dative-dependent <i lang="pi" translate="no">tappurisa</i> with reversal of the usual order, yielding the sense “bag for food”.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:6.47"><span class="parno">dn4:6.47</span>“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">4. Soṇadaṇḍa Has Second Thoughts </h3>



<p id="dn4:7.1"><span class="parno">dn4:7.1</span>Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn4:8.1"><span class="parno">dn4:8.1</span>But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind, “Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question. He might say to me: ‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask your question like that. This is how you should ask it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to ask the ascetic Gotama a rational question.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Even before he meets him, Soṇadaṇḍa has extensive knowledge of the Buddha and faith in him. It’s also notable how Soṇadaṇḍa gives Pokkharasāti a special status. Perhaps Pokkharasāti told Soṇadaṇḍa of the encounter with Ambaṭṭha in <a href="../dn/dn3.html#content">DN3</a>, which would explain his hesitation. <br> Note the use of the term <i lang="pi" translate="no">yoniso</i> here, which I render “rational”. The basic meaning of the term is “womb, source”, and it is used to mean “with reason”, which here has the sense “pertinent, relevant”.</span></span></span> And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. </p>



<p id="dn4:8.9"><span class="parno">dn4:8.9</span>Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him with my answer. He might say to me: ‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t answer the question like that. This is how you should answer it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama’s mind with his answer.’ And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. </p>



<p id="dn4:8.16"><span class="parno">dn4:8.16</span>On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s stuck-up and scared. He doesn’t dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama. For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama!’ And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:9.1"><span class="parno">dn4:9.1</span>Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For all his previous avowal of faith, Soṇadaṇḍa is merely polite, not reverential. This foreshadows the ending.</span></span></span> When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This stock passage indicates different attitudes towards the Buddha, and perhaps also different social status. Examples of such behaviors are given in Dharmaśāstras. While they might not exactly apply to this situation, they do indicate that these behaviors were nuanced and deliberate. Here is an example: “One should rise to greet a sacrificial priest, father-in-law, paternal uncle, or maternal uncle who is younger than oneself, but not verbally salute him. Likewise, one should rise to greet, but not verbally salute a different fellow-citizen who is older than oneself—even a Śūdra provided he is at least eighty—if one is equal in age to his son. And a Śūdra should rise to greet, but not verbally salute an Ārya, even if he is younger than himself.”  (Gautama 6.9–11, translation David Brick).</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:10.1"><span class="parno">dn4:10.1</span>But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts. He thought, “If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me about my own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas! Then I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">5. What Makes a Brahmin </h3>



<p id="dn4:11.1"><span class="parno">dn4:11.1</span>Then the Buddha, knowing Soṇadaṇḍa’s train of thought, thought, “This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is troubled by his own thoughts. Why don’t I ask him about his own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha goes out of his way to make him comfortable. Soṇadaṇḍa is nervous and overly eager to please, but he is not contemptuous and grinding a personal ax like Ambaṭṭha.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:11.4"><span class="parno">dn4:11.4</span>So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa, “Brahmin, how many factors must a brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood?” </p>



<p id="dn4:12.1"><span class="parno">dn4:12.1</span>Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought, “The ascetic Gotama has asked me about exactly what I wanted, what I wished for, what I desired, what I yearned for; that is, my own scriptural heritage. I can definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” </p>



<p id="dn4:13.1"><span class="parno">dn4:13.1</span>Then Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back, looked around the assembly, and said to the Buddha, “Worthy Gotama, a brahmin must possess five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood. What five? It’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He has divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. He is ethical, mature in ethical conduct. He’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Suja</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">sruc</i>) was a large wooden ladle for pouring ghee on to the sacred flame.</span></span></span> These are the five factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:14.1"><span class="parno">dn4:14.1</span>“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha uses “Socratic method”. He has the other person articulate a view, then leads them to refine their view, leading to a clearer vision of the truth.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:14.3"><span class="parno">dn4:14.3</span>“It is possible, worthy Gotama. We could leave appearance out of the five factors. For what does appearance matter? A brahmin must possess the remaining four factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:15.1"><span class="parno">dn4:15.1</span>“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these four factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>



<p id="dn4:15.3"><span class="parno">dn4:15.3</span>“It is possible, worthy Gotama. We could leave the hymns out of the four factors. For what do the hymns matter? A brahmin must possess the remaining three factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:16.1"><span class="parno">dn4:16.1</span>“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these three factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>



<p id="dn4:16.3"><span class="parno">dn4:16.3</span>“It is possible, worthy Gotama. We could leave birth out of the three factors. For what does birth matter? It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>



<p id="dn4:17.1"><span class="parno">dn4:17.1</span>When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “Please don’t say that, worthy Soṇadaṇḍa, please don’t say that! You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!” </p>



<p id="dn4:18.1"><span class="parno">dn4:18.1</span>So the Buddha said to them, “Well, brahmins, if you think that Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of debating with me about this, then leave him aside and you can debate with me. But if you think that he’s learned, a good speaker who enunciates well, astute, and capable of debating with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him debate with me.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:19.1"><span class="parno">dn4:19.1</span>When he said this, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, “Let it be, worthy Gotama, be silent. I myself will respond to them in a legitimate manner.” Then he said to those brahmins, “Don’t say this, good fellows, don’t say this: ‘You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!’ I’m not condemning appearance, hymns, or birth.” </p>



<p id="dn4:20.1"><span class="parno">dn4:20.1</span>Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa’s nephew, the young student Aṅgaka was sitting in that assembly. Then Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins, “Gentlemen, do you see my nephew, the young student Aṅgaka?” </p>



<p id="dn4:20.4"><span class="parno">dn4:20.4</span>“Yes, sir.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:20.5"><span class="parno">dn4:20.5</span>“Aṅgaka is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He has divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. There’s no-one in this assembly so good-looking, apart from the ascetic Gotama. Aṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knows them word-by-word, and their grammar. He is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And I am the one who teaches him the hymns. Aṅgaka is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. And I know his mother and father. But if Aṅgaka were to kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, and drink liquor, then what’s the use of his appearance, his hymns, or his birth? It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">6. The Discussion of Ethics and Wisdom </h3>



<p id="dn4:21.1"><span class="parno">dn4:21.1</span>“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>



<p id="dn4:21.3"><span class="parno">dn4:21.3</span>“No, worthy Gotama. For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.” </p>



<p id="dn4:22.1"><span class="parno">dn4:22.1</span>“That’s so true, brahmin, that’s so true! For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When the Buddha convinces Soṇadaṇḍa, he does not crow over it or take pleasure in his discomfort, but praises his wisdom and affirms his conclusions.</span></span></span> Ethics and wisdom always go together.

<p id="dn4:22.10"><span class="parno">dn4:22.10</span>But what, brahmin, is that ethical conduct?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha has taken pains to establish common ground, but Soṇadaṇḍa’s description of wisdom is lacking, so the Buddha prompts a deeper inquiry.</span></span></span> And what is that wisdom?” </p>



<p id="dn4:22.12"><span class="parno">dn4:22.12</span>“That’s all I know about this matter, worthy Gotama. May the worthy Gotama himself please clarify the meaning of this.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn4:23.1"><span class="parno">dn4:23.1</span>“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>



<p id="dn4:23.2"><span class="parno">dn4:23.2</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Soṇadaṇḍa replied. The Buddha said this: </p>



<p id="dn4:23.4"><span class="parno">dn4:23.4</span>“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. This, brahmin, is that ethical conduct. … They enter and remain in the first absorption …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally, the Buddha frames his teaching as ethics, meditation, and wisdom, but here he adapts to Soṇadaṇḍa’s framing and places meditation under wisdom.</span></span></span> second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption … They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision … This pertains to their wisdom. … They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’ This pertains to their wisdom. This, brahmin, is that wisdom.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">7. Soṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>



<p id="dn4:24.1"><span class="parno">dn4:24.1</span>When he had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>



<p id="dn4:24.8"><span class="parno">dn4:24.8</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Soṇadaṇḍa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed Soṇadaṇḍa had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.” </p>

<p>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Soṇadaṇḍa served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>



<p id="dn4:26.1"><span class="parno">dn4:26.1</span>When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one side. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha: </p>

<p>“Worthy Gotama, if, when I have gone to an assembly, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. If, when I have gone to an assembly, I raise my joined palms, please take it that I have risen from my seat. And if I undo my turban, please take it that I have bowed. And the worthy Gotama, if, when I am in a carriage, I get down from my carriage and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. If, when I am in a carriage, I hold up my goad, please take it that I have got down from my carriage. And if I lower my parasol, please take it that I have bowed.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Soṇadaṇḍa’s attachment to his reputation betrays his lack of inner confidence and stands in contrast with Pokkharasāti. Perhaps it may also be read as a regional characteristic, since Buddhism  was less well established in the Aṅga region than in central Magadha.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn4:27.1"><span class="parno">dn4:27.1</span>Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
