<div lang="en">


<p id="dn21:1.1.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication. The A-plot concerns Sakka’s rejection of his violent past and embrace of the Dhamma, while the B-plot concerns Pañcasikkha’s more modest growth from a libertine to a married man. <br> This discourse is quoted by name and a passage discussed at <a href="../sn/sn22.4.html#content">SN22.4</a>. In addition, the dialogue at <a href="../mn/mn37.html#content">MN37</a> picks up directly where this leaves off and may be considered a sequel. A different discourse of the same name is found at <a href="../sn/sn35.118.html#content">SN35.118</a>.</span></span></span>
</span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans, where east of Rājagaha there is a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is Indra’s hill cave.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this “the cave of Indra’s Sāl Tree”. However the Sanskrit  <i lang="pi" translate="no">yāvacchailaguhāyām</i> supports “hill cave”.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn21:1.1.3"><span class="parno">dn21:1.1.3</span>Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, grew eager to see the Buddha. He thought, “Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.1.6"><span class="parno">dn21:1.1.6</span>Seeing that the Buddha was at Indra’s hill cave, he addressed the gods of the thirty-three, “Good fellows, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave. What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn21:1.1.10"><span class="parno">dn21:1.1.10</span>“Yes, lord,” replied the gods. </p>



<p id="dn21:1.2.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.2.1</span>Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Introduced in a minor role in <a href="../dn/dn18.html#content">DN18</a>, <a href="../dn/dn19.html#content">DN19</a>, and <a href="../dn/dn20.html#content">DN20</a>, Pañcasikha gets his moment to shine in this sutta. Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in <a href="../sn/sn35.119.html#content">SN35.119</a>. His name means “Fivecrest”, evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name Pañcacūḍā, “Five Topknots”. The centaur (<i lang="pi" translate="no">gandhabba</i>) was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. He must be tamed, and here this is achieved through the power of love and filial respect. A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the <i lang="pi" translate="no">gandharva</i> with his “egg-crest” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">śikhaṇḍino</i>) is threatened with castration.</span></span></span> “Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave. What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.2.4"><span class="parno">dn21:1.2.4</span>“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “arched harp” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vīṇa</i>) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Gandhabbas</i> are closely associated with music. Māra’s harp is described in the same way (<a href="../sn/sn4.23.html#harp">SN 4.23</a>), and tradition says they were in fact the same instrument.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn21:1.2.5"><span class="parno">dn21:1.2.5</span>Then Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the thirty-three and the godling centaur Pañcasikha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, <i lang="pi" translate="no">gandhabbas</i> occupy a more humble place than the gods of the thirty-three, yet here Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In <a href="../dn/dn19.html#content">DN19</a> we saw that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The formalized hierarchies in Buddhism and Hinduism are a later conception.</span></span></span> As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the thirty-three and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of Ambasaṇḍā. </p>



<p id="dn21:1.3.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.3.1</span>Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods. People in the villages round about, terrified, shocked, and awestruck, said, “Mount Vediyaka must be on fire today, blazing and burning! Oh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā?” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.4.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.4.1</span>Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha, “My dear Pañcasikha, it is hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">We will learn later of how Sakka’s appearance could be too disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat (<a href="#dn21:1.10.8">below</a>). Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone, without a retinue. Note, however, that on subsequent occasions Sakka showed no such reticence, either because he was already a stream-enterer or because the Buddha was not in solitary retreat.</span></span></span> But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.4.4"><span class="parno">dn21:1.4.4</span>“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to Indra’s hill cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking, “This is neither too far nor too near; and he’ll hear my voice.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. Pañcasikha’s Song </h3>



<p id="dn21:1.4.8"><span class="parno">dn21:1.4.8</span>Standing to one side, Pañcasikha played his arched harp, and sang these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems like an absurd conceit, until you take into account the centaurs’ dangerous reputation as inveterate lechers. Pañcasikha wants to show that he is maturing and finally seeking a commitment in a respectable marriage.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="verse">
		<p id="dn21:1.5.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.5.1</span>
		“O Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, my Darling Sunshine,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”) accords with the Vedic conception of the wife as the Sun (Sūryā, Rig Veda 10.85) who takes as husband Soma, the moon. She appears in Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the <i lang="pi" translate="no">gandharvas</i> with their female counterpart the “nymphs” (Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">accharā</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">apsaras</i>).</span></span></span><br/>
		I pay homage to your father Timbaru,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">tumburu</i>, “coriander”) was an elder <i lang="pi" translate="no">gandharva</i> musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera. According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī; the latter name (“pretty-hair”) evokes the streaming rays of the sun   (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 = Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13).</span></span></span><br/>

Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages) brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda—the only early non-Buddhist source for a nymph named Suriyavaccasā—<i lang="pi" translate="no">aṅgīrasi</i> is associated with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Aṅgīrasa</i> is also a patronymic of the Buddha (<a href="../dn/dn32.html#angirasa">DN32</a>).</span></span></span><br/>

<p id="dn21:1.7.10"><span class="parno">dn21:1.7.10</span>When I finished, Suriyavaccasā said to me, ‘Good fellow, I have not personally seen the Buddha. But I did hear about him when I went to dance for the gods of the thirty-three in the Hall of Justice. Since you extol the Buddha, let us meet up today.’ And that’s when I met up with that sister. But we have not met since.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Approach of Sakka </h3>



<p id="dn21:1.8.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.8.1</span>Then Sakka, lord of gods, thought, “Pañcasikha is exchanging pleasantries with the Buddha.” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.8.3"><span class="parno">dn21:1.8.3</span>So he addressed Pañcasikha, “My dear Pañcasikha, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: ‘Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.’” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.8.6"><span class="parno">dn21:1.8.6</span>“Yes, lord,” replied Pañcasikha. He bowed to the Buddha and said, “Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.8.8"><span class="parno">dn21:1.8.8</span>“So may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha, “for all want to be happy—whether gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs, or any of the other diverse creatures there may be.” </p>



<p id="dn21:1.8.10"><span class="parno">dn21:1.8.10</span>For that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spirits. And being saluted by the Buddha, Sakka entered Indra’s hill cave, bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side. And the gods of the thirty-three did likewise, as did Pañcasikha. </p>



<p id="dn21:1.9.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.9.1</span>And at that time the uneven places were evened out, the cramped places were opened up, the darkness vanished in the cave and light appeared, as happens through the glory of the gods. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn21:1.9.2"><span class="parno">dn21:1.9.2</span>Then the Buddha said to Sakka, “It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable Kosiya, who has so many duties and so much to do, should come here.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as “venerable” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">āyasmā</i>), a term usually reserved for monks. Moggallāna addresses Sakka as “the venerable Kosiya” at <a href="../mn/mn37.html#kosiya">MN37</a>; Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at <a href="../ud/ud3.7.html#kosiya">Ud3.7</a>. <br> The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">kosiya</i> is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has <i lang="pi" translate="no">indra kauśika</i> which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Kuśa</i> grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. Kosiya is said to be a low class family name (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc2.html#lowfamily">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 2</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn21:1.9.4"><span class="parno">dn21:1.9.4</span>“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities for the gods of the thirty-three. This one time, sir, the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. Then I went to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. </p>

<p>But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation. And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha, standing there paying homage to him with joined palms.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A <i lang="pi" translate="no"></i> is a maid attending on a nymph (<a href="../mn/mn37.html#paricārikā">MN37</a>). <br> Bhūjati (variant <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhuñjatī</i>) does not seem to appear elsewhere.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn21:1.10.2"><span class="parno">dn21:1.10.2</span>So I said to her, ‘Sister, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: “Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn21:1.10.5"><span class="parno">dn21:1.10.5</span>When I said this, she said to me, ‘It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat.’ </p>



<p id="dn21:1.10.8"><span class="parno">dn21:1.10.8</span>‘Well then, sister, please convey my message when the Buddha emerges from that immersion.’ I hope that sister bowed to you? Do you remember what she said?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn21:1.10.12"><span class="parno">dn21:1.10.12</span>“She did bow, lord of gods, and I remember what she said. I also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersion.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sakka pointedly ignores this, but perhaps his shame at disturbing the Buddha’s meditation explains his oblique method of gaining an audience.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn21:1.11.1"><span class="parno">dn21:1.11.1</span>“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the thirty-three before me: ‘When a Realized One arises in the world, perfected and fully awakened, the heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle.’ And I have seen this with my own eyes. </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Story of Gopikā </h4>

<p id="dn21:1.11.5"><span class="parno">dn21:1.11.5</span>Right here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled her ethics.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This implies she was a stream-enterer.</span></span></span> Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In Buddhism, sex is mutable between lives and even within one life (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj1.html#genderchange">Bhikkhu Pārājika 1</a>). Later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was preferable. Here this is not stated outright, but the narrative implies that she thought her station was improved when becoming a male. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka, relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent was a woman, at least formerly, is a trope of Indian literature: a woman is the ideal misogynist (see eg. Jataka 61 or Śivapurāna chapter 4). Here, though, the situation is nuanced, because despite her (presumed) inferior status, she has better rebirth than the monks she served.</span></span></span> In the company of the gods of the thirty-three she became one of my sons. There they knew him as the godling Gopaka. </p>

<p id="dn21:1.11.10"><span class="parno">dn21:1.11.10</span>Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The realm of centaurs is “inferior” because the centaurs are known for their ribald sexuality.</span></span></span> There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants. </p>

<p id="dn21:1.11.12"><span class="parno">dn21:1.11.12</span>At that, Gopaka scolded them, ‘Where on earth were you at, good fellows, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Kutomukhā</i>, which occurs only in this sutta, contrasts with <i lang="pi" translate="no">sammukhā</i> (“in the presence of”, “from the mouth of”). The commentary explains it as a rhetorical question, “Were you distracted or falling asleep?” Alternatively, it might mean “From whom did you learn the Buddha’s teaching?” It recurs later in the verses. This is not the only such case: <i lang="pi" translate="no">duddiṭṭharūpaṁ</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ</i> are other examples of terms found nowhere else in the Pali canon, yet found here both in prose and in verse. Clearly one has been copied from the other; it seems to me that the rarity of these terms and the greater coherence of the verses suggests that the prose is a (somewhat altered) summary of the verses.</span></span></span> For while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled my ethics. I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the thirty-three I became one of Sakka’s sons. Here they know me as the godling Gopaka. But you, having led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm. It is a sad sight indeed to see fellow practitioners reborn in the inferior centaur realm.’ </p>

<p id="dn21:1.11.19"><span class="parno">dn21:1.11.19</span>
When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods regained their memory right away. They went to the host of the priests of Divinity, but one god remained attached to sensual pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary explains the verb “gained” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭilabhiṁsu</i>) as serving dual roles here: “gaining” of “absorption mindfulness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānasatiṁ</i>), upon which they “gain” rebirth in the Brahmā realm. However, the verses below speak of “recollecting” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anussaraṁ</i>) the Buddha’s teachings at this juncture. Compare <a href="../vi/bu-vb-np23.html#remembered">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 23</a>, where the king “remembered” his long-forgotten promise (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vissaritvā cirena satiṁ paṭilabhitvā</i>). <a href="../an/an4.191.html#content">AN4.191</a> speaks of the “arising of memory” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">satuppādo</i>) in a deity when reminded of Dhamma passages they once recited as a monk. <br> The phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ</i> is syntactically incongruous; I think it was clumsily copied from the verses below, where the required verb (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ajjhagaṁsu</i>) is present. The commentary explains it as “a Minister of Brahmā’s body” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmapurohitasarīraṁ</i>), but in such contexts <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāya</i> usually means “host”.</span></span></span></p>

This is one of many indications that this is a late discourse, several of which have been touched on above: late or unique terminology; fancy literary styles; adoption of doctrinal passages from elsewhere in a sometimes clumsy fashion; and so on. In determining whether a sutta is late or early, we do not rely on a single definitive reason, but on a cluster of independent criteria which taken together are most easily explained in terms of historical development.</span></span></span></p>
