<h3 class="subheading">1. The Story of the Wanderer Nigrodha </h3>



<p id="dn25:1.1"><span class="parno">dn25:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>



<p id="dn25:1.3"><span class="parno">dn25:1.3</span>Now at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was residing in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, together with a large assembly of three thousand wanderers.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha refers to the events of this sutta at <a href="../dn/dn8.html#Nigrodha">DN8:23.1</a>, but apart from that Nigrodha (“Banyan”) appears to be unknown. A “wanderer” may or may not be Brahmanical, but in DN8 Nigrodha is called <i lang="pi" translate="no">tapabrahmacārī</i>, which suggests he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. <br> The commentary describes <i lang="pi" translate="no">udumbarikā</i> (“Fig”) as <i lang="pi" translate="no">devī</i> (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. She too does not seem to appear elsewhere.</span></span></span> Then the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sandhāna (“Conciliation”) was recognized as an eminent lay follower at (<a href="../an/an6.120-139.html#content">AN6.120–139</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn25:1.5"><span class="parno">dn25:1.5</span>Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers?” So he went to the monastery of the wanderers. </p>



<p id="dn25:2.1"><span class="parno">dn25:2.1</span>Now at that time, Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. </p>



<p id="dn25:3.1"><span class="parno">dn25:3.1</span>Nigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distance, and hushed his own assembly: “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. The householder Sandhāna, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Rājagaha. Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>



<p id="dn25:4.1"><span class="parno">dn25:4.1</span>Then Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Nigrodha, “The way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of low topics is one thing. It’s quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.” </p>



<p id="dn25:5.1"><span class="parno">dn25:5.1</span>When Sandhāna said this, Nigrodha said to him, “Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom? Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. He just lurks on the periphery. He’s just like a one-eyed cow, circling around and lurking on the periphery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“One-eyed cow” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">gokāṇā</i>.</span></span></span> Go on, householder! Were the ascetic Gotama to come to this assembly, I’d sink him with just one question! I’d tie him up like a hollow pot!”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Orodheyyāma</i> normally means “enclose, trap” like ox in a pen (<a href="../an/an6.60.html#caged">AN6.60</a>), but here it is glossed in the commentary as <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinandheyyāma</i> (“twist around”).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn25:6.1"><span class="parno">dn25:6.1</span>With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer Nigrodha. Then the Buddha descended from Vulture’s Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks’ feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā, where he walked mindfully in the open air. </p>



<p id="dn25:6.3"><span class="parno">dn25:6.3</span>Nigrodha saw him, and hushed his own assembly: “Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the Sumāgadhā. The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach. If he comes, I’ll ask him this question: ‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’” Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Mortification in Disgust of Sin </h3>



<p id="dn25:7.1"><span class="parno">dn25:7.1</span>Then the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, who said to him, “Let the Blessed One come, sir! Welcome to the Blessed One, sir! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Nigrodha, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse highlights the Buddha’s method of engaging with people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win converts, but to help people be free of suffering.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn25:7.10"><span class="parno">dn25:7.10</span>Nigrodha said, “Well, sir, I saw you walking mindfully and said: ‘If the ascetic Gotama comes, I’ll ask him this question: “Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?”’ This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>



<p id="dn25:7.15"><span class="parno">dn25:7.15</span>“It’s hard for you to understand this, Nigrodha, since you have a different view, creed, and belief, unless you dedicate yourself to practice with the guidance of tradition. Please ask me a question about the higher disgust of sin in your own tradition:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Higher disgust of sin” renders <i lang="pi" translate="no">adhijegucche</i>. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of fervent mortification (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tapas</i>) to burn out the corruption.</span></span></span> ‘How are the conditions for the fervent mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">kathaṁ santā</i> is unique; it echoes <i lang="pi" translate="no">evaṁ sante</i> below.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn25:7.18"><span class="parno">dn25:7.18</span>When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar, “Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic Gotama has such power and might! For he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of others!” </p>



<p id="dn25:8.1"><span class="parno">dn25:8.1</span>Then Nigrodha, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha, “Sir, we teach fervent mortification in disgust of sin, regarding it as essential and sticking to it. How are the conditions for the fervent mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?” </p>



<p id="dn25:8.4"><span class="parno">dn25:8.4</span>“Nigrodha, it’s when a mortifier goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See the passage at <a href="../dn/dn8.html#dn8:14.1">DN8:14.2</a> and notes thereto.</span></span></span> They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. </p>

<p>They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. </p>

<p>They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground. They lie only on one side. They wear dust and dirt. They stay in the open air. They sleep wherever they lay their mat. They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods. They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids. They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening. </p>



<p id="dn25:8.22"><span class="parno">dn25:8.22</span>What do you think, Nigrodha? If this is so, is the fervent mortification in disgust of sin complete, or incomplete?” </p>



<p id="dn25:8.24"><span class="parno">dn25:8.24</span>“Clearly, sir, if that is so the fervent mortification in disgust of sin is complete, not incomplete.” </p>



<p id="dn25:8.25"><span class="parno">dn25:8.25</span>“But even such a completed mortification has many defects, I say.” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. Defects </h4>



<p id="dn25:9.1"><span class="parno">dn25:9.1</span>“But how does the Buddha say that even such a completed mortification has many defects?” </p>



<p id="dn25:9.2"><span class="parno">dn25:9.2</span>“Firstly, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They’re happy with that, as they’ve got all they wished for.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha shifts attention from the external practice to the psychological state that accompanies it.</span></span></span> This is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:9.5"><span class="parno">dn25:9.5</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They glorify themselves and put others down on account of that. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:9.8"><span class="parno">dn25:9.8</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They become indulgent and infatuated and fall into negligence on account of that. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:10.1"><span class="parno">dn25:10.1</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They generate possessions, honor, and popularity through that mortification. They’re happy with that, as they’ve got all they wished for. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:10.4"><span class="parno">dn25:10.4</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They generate possessions, honor, and popularity through that mortification. They glorify themselves and put others down on account of that. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:10.7"><span class="parno">dn25:10.7</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They generate possessions, honor, and popularity through that mortification. They become indulgent and infatuated and fall into negligence on account of that. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:10.10"><span class="parno">dn25:10.10</span>Furthermore, a mortifier becomes fussy about food, saying, ‘This is acceptable to me, this is not acceptable to me.’ What is not acceptable they give up in expectation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“In expectation” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sāpekkho</i>): when they give up something they cannot eat, they expect to be given more suitable food.</span></span></span> But what is acceptable they eat tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:10.15"><span class="parno">dn25:10.15</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification out of longing for possessions, honor, and popularity, thinking, ‘Kings, royal ministers, aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and sectarians will honor me!’ This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:11.1"><span class="parno">dn25:11.1</span>Furthermore, a mortifier rebukes a certain ascetic or brahmin, ‘But what is this one doing, living in abundance! According to this ascetic’s doctrine, everything—plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds as the fifth—is crunched together like the thunder of a tooth-hammer!’ This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:11.5"><span class="parno">dn25:11.5</span>Furthermore, a mortifier sees a certain ascetic or brahmin being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families. They think, ‘This one, who lives in abundance, is honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families. But I, a fervent mortifier who lives rough, am not honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families.’ Thus they give rise to jealousy and stinginess regarding families. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:11.10"><span class="parno">dn25:11.10</span>Furthermore, a mortifier sits meditation only when people can see them. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:11.12"><span class="parno">dn25:11.12</span>Furthermore, a mortifier sneaks about among families, thinking,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Sneaks” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">attānaṁ adassayamāno</i>, literally, “not showing himself”. They like to hang about with lay folk, but hide the fact that they do so.</span></span></span> ‘This is part of my mortification; this is part of my mortification.’ This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:11.15"><span class="parno">dn25:11.15</span>Furthermore, a mortifier sometimes behaves in an underhand manner. When asked whether something is acceptable to them, they say it is, even though it isn’t. Or they say it isn’t, even though it is. Thus they tell a deliberate lie. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:12.1"><span class="parno">dn25:12.1</span>Furthermore, a mortifier disagrees with the way that the Realized One or their disciple teaches Dhamma, even when they make a valid point. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>



<p id="dn25:12.3"><span class="parno">dn25:12.3</span>Furthermore, a mortifier is irritable and acrimonious … offensive and contemptuous … jealous and stingy … devious and deceitful … obstinate and arrogant … they have corrupt wishes, falling under the sway of corrupt wishes … they have wrong view, being attached to an extremist view … they’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As here, this item typically follows “wrong view”. At <a href="../an/an10.78.html#content">AN10.78</a> it is said to be a bad quality of Jain ascetics. Thus being “attached to one’s own views” refers both to the subjective clinging as well as the objective incorrectness of the views.</span></span></span> This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>

<p id="dn25:12.15"><span class="parno">dn25:12.15</span>What do you think, Nigrodha? Are such mortifications defective or not?” </p>



<p id="dn25:12.17"><span class="parno">dn25:12.17</span>“Clearly, sir, they’re defective. It’s possible that a mortifier might have all of these defects, let alone one or other of them.” </p>

<p id="dn25:13.1"><span class="parno">dn25:13.1</span>“Firstly, Nigrodha, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. But they’re not happy with that, as they still haven’t got all they wished for. So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:13.4"><span class="parno">dn25:13.4</span>Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification. They don’t glorify themselves or put others down on account of that. So they’re pure on that point. </p>

<p id="dn25:13.10"><span class="parno">dn25:13.10</span>They don’t glorify themselves and put others down on account of possessions, honor, and popularity … </p>



<p id="dn25:13.12"><span class="parno">dn25:13.12</span>They don’t become indulgent because of it … So they’re pure on that point. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn25:13.14"><span class="parno">dn25:13.14</span>Furthermore, a mortifier doesn’t become fussy about food, saying, ‘This is acceptable to me, this is not acceptable to me.’ What is not acceptable they give up without expectation. But what is acceptable they eat without being tied, infatuated, attached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:13.19"><span class="parno">dn25:13.19</span>Furthermore, a mortifier doesn’t undertake a practice of mortification out of longing for possessions, honor, and popularity … ‘Kings, royal ministers, aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and sectarians will honor me!’ So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:13.22"><span class="parno">dn25:13.22</span>Furthermore, a mortifier doesn’t rebuke a certain ascetic or brahmin, ‘But what is this one doing, living in abundance! According to this ascetic’s doctrine, everything—plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds as the fifth—is crunched together like the thunder of a tooth-hammer!’ So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:14.1"><span class="parno">dn25:14.1</span>Furthermore, a mortifier sees a certain ascetic or brahmin being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families. It never occurs to them, ‘This one, who lives in abundance, is honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families. But I, a fervent mortifier who lives rough, am not honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families.’ Thus they don’t give rise to jealousy and stinginess regarding families. So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:14.6"><span class="parno">dn25:14.6</span>Furthermore, a mortifier doesn’t sit meditation only when people can see them. So they’re pure on that point. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn25:14.8"><span class="parno">dn25:14.8</span>Furthermore, a mortifier doesn’t sneak about among families, thinking, ‘This is part of my mortification; this is part of my mortification.’ So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:14.11"><span class="parno">dn25:14.11</span>Furthermore, a mortifier never behaves in an underhand manner. When asked whether something is acceptable to them, they say it isn’t when it isn’t. Or they say it is when it is. Thus they don’t tell a deliberate lie. So they’re pure on that point. </p>



<p id="dn25:15.1"><span class="parno">dn25:15.1</span>Furthermore, a mortifier agrees with the way that the Realized One or their disciple teaches Dhamma when they make a valid point. So they’re pure on that point. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn25:15.3"><span class="parno">dn25:15.3</span>Furthermore, a mortifier is not irritable and acrimonious … offensive and contemptuous … jealous and stingy … devious and deceitful … obstinate and arrogant … they don’t have corrupt wishes … and wrong view … they’re not attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go. So they’re pure on that point. </p>

The Jain text Uttarādhyayanasūtra 23 shows that Mahāvīra added nakedness to make five. Five are also found in Yogasūtra 2.30 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7: non-harming (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ahiṁsā</i>), truth (<i lang="pi" translate="no">satya</i>), no stealing (<i lang="pi" translate="no">asteya</i>), celibacy (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmacarya</i>), and non-possessiveness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">aparigrahā</i>). <br> A different “fourfold restraint” is said to be a Jain practice at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:28.1">DN2:29.1</a>.</span></span></span> And how is a mortifier restrained in the fourfold constraint? It’s when a mortifier doesn’t kill living creatures, doesn’t get others to kill, and doesn’t approve of killing.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This extends the basic precept. The same analysis is applied to the “ten ways of performing deeds” at <a href="../an/an3.163.html#content">AN3.163</a>. <br>
The distinction between one’s own action and another’s action is noted at Isibhāsiyāiṁ 31.42, although the wording and sense are different.</span></span></span> They don’t steal, get others to steal, or approve of stealing. They don’t lie, get others to lie, or approve of lying. They don’t expect rewards from their practice, they don’t lead others to expect rewards, and they don’t approve of expecting rewards.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Bhāvitamāsīsati</i> is unique.

<p id="dn25:16.10"><span class="parno">dn25:16.10</span>When a mortifier is restrained in the fourfold constraint, that is their mortification. They step forward, not falling back. </p>

<p>They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence. Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>



<p id="dn25:17.1"><span class="parno">dn25:17.1</span>They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view.

That’s what I use to guide my disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life.” </p>



<p id="dn25:19.20"><span class="parno">dn25:19.20</span>When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar, “In that case, we’re lost, and so is our tradition! We don’t know anything better or finer than that!” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">4. Nigrodha Feels Depressed </h3>



<p id="dn25:20.1"><span class="parno">dn25:20.1</span>Then the householder Sandhāna realized, “Obviously, now these wanderers want to listen to what the Buddha says. They’re actively listening and trying to understand!” </p>



<p id="dn25:20.3"><span class="parno">dn25:20.3</span>So he said to the wanderer Nigrodha, “Honorable Nigrodha, remember you said this to me: ‘Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom? Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. He just lurks on the periphery. He’s just like a one-eyed cow, circling around and lurking on the periphery. Please, householder, let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly. I’ll sink him with just one question! I’ll roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot!’ Now the Blessed One, perfected and fully awakened, has arrived here. Why don’t you send him out of the assembly to the periphery like a one-eyed cow? Why don’t you sink him with just one question? Why don’t you roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot?” When he said this, Nigrodha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>



<p id="dn25:21.1"><span class="parno">dn25:21.1</span>Knowing this, the Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, Nigrodha—are those your words?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn25:21.3"><span class="parno">dn25:21.3</span>“It’s true, sir, those are my words. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me.” </p>



<p id="dn25:21.4"><span class="parno">dn25:21.4</span>“What do you think, Nigrodha? Have you heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said that when the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together, they made an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of low topics, like you do in your tradition these days? Or did they say that the Buddhas frequented remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat, like I do these days?” </p>



<p id="dn25:21.10"><span class="parno">dn25:21.10</span>“I have heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior, said that when the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together, they didn’t make an uproar, like I do in my tradition these days.

<p id="dn25:22.4"><span class="parno">dn25:22.4</span>“Indeed, Nigrodha, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to speak in that way.

<p id="dn25:23.17"><span class="parno">dn25:23.17</span>You might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to stop doing things that are skillful and considered skillful in our tradition.’ But you should not see it like this.

<p id="dn25:23.21"><span class="parno">dn25:23.21</span>I do not speak for any of these reasons. Nigrodha, there are things that are unskillful, corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. I teach Dhamma so that those things may be given up. When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.” </p>



<p id="dn25:24.1"><span class="parno">dn25:24.1</span>When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, as if their minds were possessed by Māra.

<p id="dn25:24.6"><span class="parno">dn25:24.6</span>Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, rose into the air and landed on Vulture’s Peak. Meanwhile, the householder Sandhāna went right back to Rājagaha. </p>
