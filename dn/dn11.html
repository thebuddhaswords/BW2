<div lang="en">
<p id="dn11:1.1"><span class="parno">dn11:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This was the scene for some controversial discussions with Jains (<a href="../mn/mn56.html#content">MN 56</a>, <a href="../sn/sn42.8.html#content">SN42.8</a>), and Sāriputta’s touching declaration of faith shortly before his passing (<a href="../sn/sn47.12.html#content">SN47.12</a>, <a href="../dn/dn16.html#content">DN16</a>, <a href="../dn/dn28.html#content">DN28</a>). It is probably the Pāvā (modern Pawapuri) at which Mahāvīra died according to the Jain tradition.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn11:1.3"><span class="parno">dn11:1.3</span>Then the householder Kevaḍḍha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa (“fisherman”). The Chinese form <span lang="lzh">堅固</span> means “sturdy” (from <i lang="pi" translate="no">dṛḍha</i>) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha.</span></span></span> “Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I have been asked to do the same thing for the same reason.</span></span></span> Then Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the Buddha!” </p>



<p id="dn11:1.7"><span class="parno">dn11:1.7</span>When he said this, the Buddha said, “Kevaḍḍha, I do not teach Dhamma to the mendicants like this: ‘Come now, mendicants, perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for the white-clothed laypeople.’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In fact it is forbidden in <a href="../vi/kd15.html#unsuitable">Khandhaka 15</a>.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:2.1"><span class="parno">dn11:2.1</span>For a second time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request, “Sir, I am not teaching you the Dhamma,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhaṁsemi</i> is dubious. An old Burmese manuscript has the reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhammaṁ desemi</i>, which echoes the Buddha just above. Note too that Kevaḍḍha urges the Buddha to “direct” the monks (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samādisatu</i>, from the same root as <i lang="pi" translate="no">desemi</i>). I think the tension is deliberate: Kevaḍḍha says he isn’t telling the Buddha how to teach, but he absolutely is. Other readings convey the sense “attack, insult”, but this seems out of place.</span></span></span> but nonetheless I say: ‘Sir, this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. Please direct a mendicant to perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power. Then Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the Buddha!’” But for a second time, the Buddha gave the same answer. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:3.1"><span class="parno">dn11:3.1</span>For a third time, Kevaḍḍha made the same request, at which the Buddha said the following. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. The Demonstration of Psychic Power </h3>



<p id="dn11:3.8"><span class="parno">dn11:3.8</span>“Kevaḍḍha, there are three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As noted previously, the basic sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāṭihāriya</i> is “demonstration”, and as the context here shows, it may or may not involve a “demonstration of wonders” i.e. a “miracle”.</span></span></span> What three? The demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the demonstration of instruction.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth.</span></span></span></p>



<hr>

<p id="dn11:4.1"><span class="parno">dn11:4.1</span>And what is the demonstration of psychic power? It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity. </p>



<p id="dn11:4.3"><span class="parno">dn11:4.3</span>Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those superhuman feats. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:4.4"><span class="parno">dn11:4.4</span>They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Their priors have been confirmed.</span></span></span> I saw him myself, performing all these superhuman feats!’ </p>



<p id="dn11:5.1"><span class="parno">dn11:5.1</span>But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note how a skeptical mindset sticks closer to the truth.</span></span></span> ‘There’s a spell named Gandhārī.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Spell” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">vijjā</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">vidyā</i>, “(potent) knowledge”, cf. English “wicca”, “wizard”, “witch”).  The commentary says it was practiced by the seers of Gandhāra (north-west Pakistan). Jain tradition also knows a Gandhārī mantra, but attribute it to certain <i lang="pi" translate="no">vidyādhara</i> deities. Sanskrit tradition similarly knows of a <i lang="pi" translate="no">vidyādevī</i> (“lore goddess”) named Gandhārī. Gandhāra was an ancient land of learning, and a convenient location for exotic magics.</span></span></span> Using that a mendicant can perform such superhuman feats.’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:5.4"><span class="parno">dn11:5.4</span>What do you think, Kevaḍḍha? Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:5.6"><span class="parno">dn11:5.6</span>“They would, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn11:5.7"><span class="parno">dn11:5.7</span>“Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These feats that have nothing to do with spiritual growth, hence they may be produced or perhaps faked by a variety of means.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Demonstration of Revealing </h3>



<p id="dn11:6.1"><span class="parno">dn11:6.1</span>And what is the demonstration of revealing?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Revealing” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">ādesana</i>, from root <i lang="pi" translate="no">dis</i> “to indicate, show, or point”.</span></span></span> It’s when a mendicant reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings and individuals:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali terms here are <i lang="pi" translate="no">citta</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">cetasika</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vitakka</i>, and <i lang="pi" translate="no">vicāra</i>.</span></span></span> ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we have <i lang="pi" translate="no">mano</i> (twice) and <i lang="pi" translate="no">citta</i>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn11:6.4"><span class="parno">dn11:6.4</span>Someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another person’s thoughts. They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might! I saw him myself, revealing the thoughts of another person!’ </p>



<p id="dn11:7.1"><span class="parno">dn11:7.1</span>But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: ‘There’s a spell named Māṇikā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">From <i lang="pi" translate="no">maṇi</i>, “gem”. Magical gems are a common feature of Indian storytelling. Buddhist stories often feature the “wish-granting gem” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">cintāmaṇi</i>), which according to the commentary is meant here.</span></span></span> Using that a mendicant can reveal another person’s thoughts.’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:7.5"><span class="parno">dn11:7.5</span>What do you think, Kevaḍḍha? Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” </p>



<p id="dn11:7.7"><span class="parno">dn11:7.7</span>“They would, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn11:7.8"><span class="parno">dn11:7.8</span>“Seeing this drawback in revealing, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of revealing. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. The Demonstration of Instruction </h3>



<p id="dn11:8.1"><span class="parno">dn11:8.1</span>And what is the demonstration of instruction? It’s when a mendicant instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ This is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:9-66.1"><span class="parno">dn11:9-66.1</span>Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … This is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>



<p id="dn11:9-66.5"><span class="parno">dn11:9-66.5</span>They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>



<p id="dn11:9-66.9"><span class="parno">dn11:9-66.9</span>They project and extend the mind toward knowledge and vision … This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>



<p id="dn11:9-66.11"><span class="parno">dn11:9-66.11</span>They understand: ‘… there is nothing further for this place.’ This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:67.1"><span class="parno">dn11:67.1</span>These, Kevaḍḍha, are the three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">4. On the Mendicant in Search of the Cessation of Being </h3>



<p id="dn11:67.3"><span class="parno">dn11:67.3</span>Once upon a time, Kevaḍḍha, a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thought,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This story is presented as an actual event, but is phrased like a fable.</span></span></span> ‘Where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The question is about meditation, not the annihilation of the material world. The first four <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> are based on the “subtle form” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sukhumarūpa</i>) that manifests as light in deep meditation. He is asking how to go beyond this to the formless attainments.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:68.1"><span class="parno">dn11:68.1</span>Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appeared.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The mendicant has already well developed the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i>. <br> “Controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm” is one of the “demonstrations of psychic power” listed above.</span></span></span> Then he approached the gods of the four great kings and said,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms.</span></span></span> ‘Reverends, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn11:68.4"><span class="parno">dn11:68.4</span>When he said this, those gods said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. But the four great kings are our superiors.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are powerful spirits who guard the four quarters. In <a href="../an/an8.36.html#4greatkings">AN8.36</a> it is explained that they, like the other leading gods mentioned below, achieved their station due to their greater generosity and morality.</span></span></span> They might know.’ </p>



<p id="dn11:69.1"><span class="parno">dn11:69.1</span>Then he approached the four great kings and asked the same question. But they also said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. But the gods of the thirty-three …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “thirty-three” enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2). The final pair are elsewhere said to be Dyaus (“Heaven” = Zeus) and Pṛthivī (“Earth”), or the twin Aśvins.</span></span></span> Sakka, lord of gods …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Conventionally known as “lord of gods”, but in fact the ruler only of the relatively lowly realm of the thirty-three. He is Vedic Indra, heroic slayer of the dragon Vṛtra, and is the most personally known god in the Pali Canon.</span></span></span> the gods of Yama …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gods in this realm (spelled <i lang="pi" translate="no">yāma</i>, “of Yama”) are subjects of the god of the dead, Yama.</span></span></span> the godling named Suyāma … the Joyful gods … the godling named Santussita … the gods who love to imagine … the godling named Sunimmita … the gods who control the creation of others … the godling named Vasavattī … the gods of the Divinity’s host are our superiors. They might know.’ </p>



<p id="dn11:80.1"><span class="parno">dn11:80.1</span>Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to divinity appeared. Then he approached the gods of the Divinity’s host and said, ‘Reverends, where do these four principal states cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ But they also said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The previous deities achieved their station by mere morality and generosity, not by <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. The gods of Brahmā’s Host practiced the first <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, but they do not know what lies beyond.</span></span></span> But there is the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. He is our superior.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The same passage appears in <a href="../dn/dn1.html#creator">DN1</a>, where it also had a satirical tone, poking fun at the pomposity of religious titles.</span></span></span> He might know.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Even Brahmā’s community are not confident.</span></span></span></p>

I think the Buddha is quoting Brahmā here in order to contrast with his own teaching of the cessation of consciousness, to emphasize that <em>even this</em> most sublime form of consciousness will cease. <br> “Where no form appears” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anidassanaṁ</i>) here is a synonym for “formless” (see eg. <a href="../mn/mn21.html#formless">MN21</a>, “space is formless and invisible”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">ākāso arūpī anidassano</i>). Normally the colors and images seen in the “form” absorptions are described as “appearing” (eg. <a href="../dn/dn16.html#colours">DN16</a>), so this indicates a formless attainment.</span></span></span><br/>

Yājñavalkya describes consciousness as infinite in the famous passage at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Pabhaṁ</i> means “luminous”, as with the deities that are “self-luminous” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sayaṁpabhā</i>, <a href="../dn/dn27.html#selfluminous">DN27</a>).
