<h3>1. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers</h3>

<p id="dn2:1.1"><span class="parno">dn2:1.1</span>So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta with its commentary was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his <em>The Fruits of Recluseship</em>.</span></span></span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This monastery belonged to the Buddha’s doctor, Jīvaka, who appears later in the sutta. His story is told in <a href="../vi/kd8.html#content">Khandhaka 8</a>, where we learn that he was raised by Prince Abhaya of Magadha, a Jain (<a href="../mn/mn58.html">MN 58</a>) who was also interested in the teachings of  Pūraṇa Kassapa (<a href="../sn/sn46.56.html#content">SN46.56</a>). <a href="../mn/mn55.html#content">MN55</a> on eating meat is addressed to him.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn2:1.3"><span class="parno">dn2:1.3</span>Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudī full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Komudī was an especially celebrated full moon on the last month of the rainy season (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kattikā</i>, October/November), when the skies were clear, the lotuses (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kumudā</i>) were in bloom, and the moon was in conjunction with the Pleiades, which gave the month its name.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn2:1.4"><span class="parno">dn2:1.4</span>Then Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, expressed this heartfelt sentiment,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Ajātasattu</i> (“one against whom no foe is born”) was the son of Bimbisāra and heir to the Haryaṅka dynasty of Magadha. In inscription and Jain tradition he is also called Kūṇika. Jain tradition holds that his mother was Cellaṇā daughter of Ceṭaka, a Licchavī ruler from Vesālī. This begs the question as to why Cellaṇā was said to be “of Videha”; perhaps he married a Videhan princess to forge an alliance with the Licchavī’s northern neighbors. In any case, this is more plausible than the Buddhist tradition that his mother was Kosalan.</span></span></span> “Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so striking.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pāsādikā</i> here does not mean “tranquil”; it is part of a stock list of terms meaning “beautiful, attractive” (eg. <a href="../dn/dn4.html#pasadiko">DN4.23</a>). 	<br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Lakkhaññā</i> is unique in early Pali. It is probably a synonym in the sense of “possessing remarkable features, striking”, rather than “auspicious”.</span></span></span> Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?” <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The king seeks redemption through his own actions; it is not that the ascetic has any special power to bring peace to his mind. 	<br> The sutta is deliberately holding back the reason for the king’s distress. Compare <a href="../an/an5.50.html#content">AN5.50</a>, where the reason for King Muṇḍa seeking solace is stated up front.</span></span></span>
</p>



<p id="dn2:2.1"><span class="parno">dn2:2.1</span>When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Though the king mentioned “ascetics and brahmins”, his advisers only recommend famous teachers of the ascetics (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samaṇa</i>). For a shorter survey of their doctrines, see <a href="../sn/sn2.30.html#content">SN2.30</a>.</span></span></span> “Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A little-known teacher of the inefficacy of action and consequence, Pūraṇa was poorly regarded even by his own students (<a href="../mn/mn77.html#purana_kassapa">MN77.6</a>). He is said to have advocated a doctrine of six classes of rebirth (<a href="../an/an6.57.html#content">AN6.57</a>; the same text reverentially mentions Makkhali Gosāla). 	<br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Pūraṇa</i> means “filling” (not <i lang="pi" translate="no">purāṇa</i>, “ancient”).</span></span></span> leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent.</p>



<p id="dn2:3.1"><span class="parno">dn2:3.1</span>Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Founder of the Ājīvakas, who became the third largest ascetic movement after Buddhism and Jainism. None of their texts survive, but their teachings can be partially reconstructed from Buddhist and Jain sources. He practiced with Mahāvīra for six years before an acrimonious split, following which he developed his doctrine of hard determinism. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Makkhali</i> denotes a kind of ascetic bearing a bamboo staff, so (like the similar appellations <i lang="pi" translate="no">nigaṇṭha</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">samaṇa</i>) it indicates his affiliation. This being so, and noting that Buddhist Sanskrit texts spell his name as <i lang="pi" translate="no">gośālīputra</i> etc., the second name (like <i lang="pi" translate="no">nātaputta</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">gotama</i>) might indicate his clan. However, I can find no trace of such a clan, and both Jain and Buddhist tradition, albeit unreliably, say the name arose because he was born in a cowshed.</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>



<p id="dn2:4.1"><span class="parno">dn2:4.1</span>Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Ajita of the hair blanket leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A materialist, he was an early proponent of the ideas later known as Cārvāka. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Kesakambala</i> means “hair-blanket”, which was worn as an ascetic practice (<a href="../an/an3.137.html#content">AN3.137</a>).</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>



<p id="dn2:5.1"><span class="parno">dn2:5.1</span>Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Another obscure teacher, he taught a reductive atomism which negated the possibility of action with consequences. His first name is sometimes spelled Kakudha; both words signify a hump or crest.</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>



<p id="dn2:6.1"><span class="parno">dn2:6.1</span>Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An agnostic, he is evidently the “wanderer Sañjaya” who was the first teacher of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before they left him to follow the Buddha (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#goingforth">Kd1.220</a>). His name is obscure. Sanskrit spells it <i lang="pi" translate="no">vairaṭṭīputra</i>, with several variations, but always with <i lang="pi" translate="no">ṭi</i>. The commentary says he was the “son of Belaṭṭha”.</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>



<p id="dn2:7.1"><span class="parno">dn2:7.1</span>Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Jain leader Mahāvīra Vardhamāna is known as Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in Pali texts. He is regarded as the 24th supreme leader of the Jains, although only he and his predecessor Pārśvanātha (not mentioned in the Pali) are historical. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Nigaṇṭha</i> means “knotless” (i.e. without attachments). As a term for Jain ascetics it is also found in Jain literature. Nātaputta indicates his clan the Ñātikas (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">jñātiputra</i>; Prākrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāyaputta</i>). The Pali tradition has confused <i lang="pi" translate="no">ñāti</i>  (“family”) with <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāṭa</i> (“dancer”). Thus Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta means “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan”. 	<br> Jainism and Buddhism are the only ancient <i lang="pi" translate="no">samaṇa</i> movements to survive to the present day. The primary Jain teaching is the practice of non-violence while burning off past kamma by fervent austerities in order to reach omniscient liberation.</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca </h3>



<p id="dn2:8.1"><span class="parno">dn2:8.1</span>Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">His absence of speech signifies his wisdom. The narrative creates a dramatic expectation through his stillness, an exquisitely Buddhist aesthetic choice.</span></span></span> Then the king said to him, “But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?” </p>



<p id="dn2:8.4"><span class="parno">dn2:8.4</span>“Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to the Vinaya, a monastery is normally offered to the “Saṅgha of the four quarters” and becomes their inalienable property. In the suttas this is not so clear, and it seems that Jīvaka still regarded the property as his. In practice there would have been a variety of arrangements, as there are today.</span></span></span> He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first appearance of the famous <i lang="pi" translate="no">iti pi so</i> formula. It is still recited in praise of the Buddha in Theravada communities.</span></span></span> Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn2:8.9"><span class="parno">dn2:8.9</span>“Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.” </p>



<p id="dn2:9.1"><span class="parno">dn2:9.1</span>“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, “The elephants are ready, sire. Please go at your convenience.” </p>



<p id="dn2:10.1"><span class="parno">dn2:10.1</span>Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Indian kings were guarded by armed women inside the harem (Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 1.21.1) and also while on hunt (Megasthenes’s Indica, via Strabo XV. i. 53–56). This passage may be the earliest evidence for this long-lasting practice. See also <a href="../dn/dn23.html#hunchbacks">DN23.21</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<a id="silence"></a>

<p id="dn2:10.2"><span class="parno">dn2:10.2</span>But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. He said to Jīvaka, “My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me! I hope you’re not betraying me! I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies! For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The silence of the Buddha’s assembly is often contrasted with the rowdy gatherings of other ascetics, for example that of Poṭṭhapāda at <a href="../dn/dn9.html#noisy">DN9</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn2:10.8"><span class="parno">dn2:10.8</span>“Do not fear, great king, do not fear! I am not deceiving you, or betraying you, or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a double pun. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Dīpa</i> means “lamp” or “island, refuge”, while <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāyati</i> means “burning” or “meditating”. So it could be rendered, “those are saviors meditating in the pavilion”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Jhāyati</i> is the verb form of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> (“absorption”), which is the central practice of meditation described below.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life </h3>



<p id="dn2:11.1"><span class="parno">dn2:11.1</span>Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka, “But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha looked like any other monk. But this also reveals Ajātasattu’s spiritual blindness.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn2:11.3"><span class="parno">dn2:11.3</span>“That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha! He’s sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of mendicants.” </p>



<p id="dn2:12.1"><span class="parno">dn2:12.1</span>Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">He has not yet gained faith, so does not bow.</span></span></span> He looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!” </p>


<hr>

<p>There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600; 500 deeds, and five, and three; deeds and half-deeds; 62 paths of practice, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life; 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 dragon abodes; 2,000 lordships, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dusky sky; seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, seven knotless embryos, seven gods, seven mental heavens, seven goblins, seven streams, seven castoff incarnations and 700 castoff incarnations, seven downfalls and 700 downfalls, seven dreams and 700 dreams, and 8.4 million great eons—through all of which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “wombs” are probably species through which one transmigrates. 	<br> The many kinds of deeds classified by Ājīvakas have only contingent effect, as the ultimate course of transmigration is fixed.

And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The denial of “mother and father” is usually interpreted as the denial of moral duty towards one’s parents. However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators.</span></span></span> This person is made up of the four principal states.

The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a materialist analysis of the person. 	<br> The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāya</i> (“substance”) is central to Jainism.

For the Buddha, the “principal states” are themselves plural, as there is no underlying singular reality. Later Sanskrit literature lists the “five states” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pañcabhūta</i>) as earth, water, fire, air, and space.</span></span></span> Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of morons.

All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in this very life. With that they make themselves happy and pleased. They make their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues happy and pleased.

Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in this very life?” </p>

Only the ethics portion appeared in the Brahmajālasutta, while all three are restated in all the remaining suttas of this chapter, although in truncated form. <br> It is exceedingly rare for a Buddha to appear.</span></span></span> He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha realizes the truth by his own understanding, not through divine intervention or other metaphysical means.</span></span></span> He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased.

For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is not that one cannot see things, but that, mindful of its effect, one avoids unnecessary stimulation. <br> “Covetousness and bitterness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhijjhā domanassā</i>) are the strong forms of desire and aversion caused by lack of restraint.</span></span></span> When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming.

(2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects.
