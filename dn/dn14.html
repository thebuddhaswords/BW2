<h3 class="subheading">1. On Past Lives </h3>



<p id="dn14:1.1.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the suttas, <i lang="pi" translate="no">apadāna</i> means “evidence”, “traces left behind” (<a href="../dn/dn27.html#apadana">DN27</a>, <a href="../an/an3.2.html#content">AN3.2</a>). The sense here seems to have been “(story about) the traces that deeds leave behind”. The sense “legend of past lives” probably grew out of this sutta, and later became the title of the collections of legends of past lives of the monks (Thera-apadāna) and nuns (Therī-apadāna).</span></span></span></span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, in the hut by the kareri tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Kareri</i> is evidently <i lang="la">Miliusa tomentosa</i>, known as <i lang="hi">hoom</i> or <i lang="hi">kari</i> in Hindi. It is related to the custard apple, not the curry tree (<i lang="la">Murraya koenigii</i>).</span></span></span> </p>



<p id="dn14:1.1.3"><span class="parno">dn14:1.1.3</span>Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kareri tree and this Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives came up among them, “So it was in a past life; such it was in a past life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Past life” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">pubbenivāsa</i>, literally “former abode”.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.2.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.2.1</span>With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion among the mendicants. So he got up from his seat and went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>



<p id="dn14:1.2.4"><span class="parno">dn14:1.2.4</span>The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, “This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.3.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.3.1</span>“Would you like to hear a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?” </p>



<p id="dn14:1.3.2"><span class="parno">dn14:1.3.2</span>“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha give a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>



<p id="dn14:1.3.4"><span class="parno">dn14:1.3.4</span>“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>



<p id="dn14:1.3.5"><span class="parno">dn14:1.3.5</span>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.4.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.4.1</span>“Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At <a href="../mn/mn71.html#91eons">MN71</a> and <a href="../sn/sn42.9.html#91eons">SN42.9</a> the Buddha says he recollects ninety-one eons, which must refer back to the life of Vipassī. We shall see the origin of his name below.</span></span></span> Thirty-one eons ago, the Buddha Sikhī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Sikhī</i> means “crested one” and refers to a halo or crown. A story of him and his disciples is told at <a href="../sn/sn6.14.html#content">SN6.14</a>.</span></span></span> In the same thirty-first eon, the Buddha Vessabhū arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Vessabhū</i> is Sanskrit Viśvabhṛt. It means “all-bearing”, probably originating as a word for the earth. A legendary king of the same name once ruled over the city of Avantī (<a href="../dn/dn19.html#vessabhu">DN19</a>).</span></span></span> In the present fortunate eon, the Buddhas Kakusandha,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Due to the appearance of four Buddhas in this cycle it is known as “fortunate” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhadda</i>). <br> Stories from Kakusandha’s day appear at <a href="../mn/mn50.html#kakusandha">MN50</a> and <a href="../sn/sn15.20.html#content">SN15.20</a>. There is no obvious etymology for his name, but perhaps it stems from <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaku</i> (“peak”) and thus “the union of the peaks”, a valley at the junction of mountains.</span></span></span> Koṇāgamana,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The meaning of Koṇāgamana is unclear. In Sanskrit it is often spelled Kanakamuni, “the golden sage”, while in the (dubious) Nigali Sagar Edict of Ashoka it is Konākamana. At <a href="../thi/thi16.html#konagamana">Therigatha 16</a> we hear the past life of three nuns in the time of Koṇāgamana.</span></span></span> and Kassapa arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kassapa (Sanskrit Kaśyapa) means “tortoise”. It is a common Brahmanical clan name, stemming from an ancient figure reckoned as the eldest of the “seven sages”, to whom some Vedic verses are attributed. Details of the Buddha Kassapa’s time are found at <a href="../mn/mn81.html#kassapa">MN81</a>, <a href="../sn/sn15.20.html#kassapa">SN15.20</a>, and <a href="../sn/sn48.57.html#kassapa">SN48.57</a>.</span></span></span> And in the present fortunate eon, I have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These numbers make up a quasi-logarithmic scale: the time gaps multiply by three, while the number of Buddhas divides by two. In eon one there are four Buddhas. Thirty eons ago the number is halved, so they had two Buddhas. Twice-thirty eons before that, the number is halved again, to one Buddha, thus ending the scale.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.5.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.5.1</span>The Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū were born as aristocrats into aristocrat families. The Buddhas Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa were born as brahmins into brahmin families. I was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In ancient India, the “aristocrats” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i>) and the brahmins vied for the prestige of being the highest class. The traditional business of the aristocrats was land, politics, agriculture, and war, while the brahmins were a hereditary priestly caste who served as advisers and ritualists. It is said that the Buddha-to-be was born in whatever caste was most prestigious at the time so that his word would have the most impact. <br> In this sutta, the Buddha simply refers to himself as “I” with no personal name. When the seven Buddhas are listed at <a href="../dn/dn32.html#angirasa">DN32</a>, however, he is called Aṅgīrasa.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.6.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.6.1</span>Koṇḍañña was the clan of Vipassī,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Koṇḍaññas (Sanskrit Kauṇḍinya) originated as the leading clan of the city of Kuṇḍina the capital of Vidarbha, which is probably modern Kaundinyapura on the Wardha River.</span></span></span> Sikhī, and Vessabhū. Kassapa was the clan of Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. Gotama is my clan.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gotama is an ancient Brahmanical clan name, which like Kassapa stems from the Vedas and the seven sages. Why does the Buddha, an aristocrat, have a Brahmanical clan? During initiation by a Brahmanical family priest (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>), an aristocrat was ritually determined to be a brahmin for a short time, during which he would assume the lineage name of the priest. After being restored as an aristocrat, he and his family would still be referred to by that name. Thus the Sakyans’ <i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i> must have been of the Gotama lineage. Other examples of this practice include the Mallas who are called Vāseṭṭha (<a href="../dn/dn16.html#vasettha">DN16</a>) and Saccaka who is called Aggivessana (<a href="../mn/mn35.html#aggivessana">MN35</a>). The Jain Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.15.15 records a similar situation, for while Mahāvīra was, like the Buddha, a <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i>, he was of the Kāśyapa <i lang="pi" translate="no">gotta</i>, and various relatives were assigned to Vāsiṣṭha,  Kauṇḍinya, and  Kauśika.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:1.7.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.7.1</span>For Vipassī, the lifespan was 80,000 years. For Sikhī, the lifespan was 70,000 years. For Vessabhū, the lifespan was 60,000 years. For Kakusandha, the lifespan was 40,000 years. For Koṇāgamana, the lifespan was 30,000 years. For Kassapa, the lifespan was 20,000 years. For me at this time the life-span is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more. </p>



<p id="dn14:1.8.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.8.1</span>Vipassī was awakened at the root of a patala tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Stereospermum chelonoides</em>. Dictionaries of Pali and Sanskrit call this the “trumpet-flower tree”, but that is more commonly used for <em>Oroxylum indicum</em>.</span></span></span> Sikhī was awakened at the root of a white-mango tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Puṇḍarīka</i> is the white lotus, but here it is the name of a tree. The commentary says this is <i lang="pi" translate="no">setamba</i> (“white-mango”). It is not, however, the mango variety known by that name today (<em>Mangifera caesia</em>), which is not found in India.</span></span></span> Vessabhū was awakened at the root of a sal tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Shorea robusta</em>.</span></span></span> Kakusandha was awakened at the root of a sirisa tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Albizia lebbeck</em>, sometimes still known by the old name of sirisa. Older sources sometimes call it an acacia.</span></span></span> Koṇāgamana was awakened at the root of a cluster fig tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Ficus racemosa</em>.</span></span></span> Kassapa was awakened at the root of a banyan tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Ficus benghalensis</em>.</span></span></span> I was awakened at the root of a peepal tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Ficus religiosa</em>, sacred to Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus alike. Ancient sources referred to it both as <i lang="pi" translate="no">assattha</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">aśvattha</i>) and <i lang="pi" translate="no">pippala</i>. Buddhists today simply call it the Bodhi (or Bo) tree.</span></span></span></p>

Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Abhibhū means “Victor”, while Sambhava means “son of Śambhu the blessed”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Śambhu</i> is commonly found in the Rig Veda in the sense, “blessing, benefit”, and became a common name or epithet of gods, etc.</span></span></span> Vessabhū had a fine pair of chief disciples named Soṇa and Uttara.

<p id="dn14:1.33.9"><span class="parno">dn14:1.33.9</span>Then King Bandhumā had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in unworn clothes and satisfied all their needs.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the <i lang="pi" translate="no">dakkhiṇā</i>, the religious offering given in gratitude and respect for the services.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then the king appointed nursemaids for Prince Vipassī.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">His birth mother has passed away and there is no mention of a step-mother.</span></span></span> Some suckled him, some bathed him, some held him, and some carried him on their hip. From when he was born, a white parasol was held over him night and day, with the thought, ‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’ He was dear and beloved by many people, like a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. He was always passed from hip to hip. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.35.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.35.1</span>From when he was born, his voice was charming, graceful, sweet, and lovely. It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoo-bird found in the Himalayas. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.36.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.36.1</span>From when he was born, Prince Vipassī had the power of clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds, by which he could see for a league all around both by day and by night.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally clairvoyance and related abilities are said to arise due to the power of the fourth <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, whereas here it comes naturally due to past kamma. After <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> this ability is empowered by the radiant mind clear of hindrances, whereas here it seems to be a more limited ability to see clearly and in the dark.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.37.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.37.1</span>And he was unblinkingly watchful, like the gods of the thirty-three. And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, he came to be known as ‘Vipassī’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vipassī’s name is simply the personal form of the word made famous in Buddhist meditation, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vipassanā</i>. This is usually rendered as “insight”, but the sense here is more like “clear seeing”.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn14:1.37.3"><span class="parno">dn14:1.37.3</span>Then while King Bandhumā was sitting in court, he’d sit Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him. And sitting there in his father’s lap, Vipassī would thoroughly consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical system. So this was all the more reason for him to be known as ‘Vipassī’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Indian epistemology acknowledges two fundamental sources of knowledge: direct perception (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paccakkha</i>) and inference (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anumāna</i>).

<p id="dn14:1.38.1"><span class="parno">dn14:1.38.1</span>Then King Bandhumā had three stilt longhouses built for him—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season, and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.

Here this is treated as a meditative contemplation, whereas the next sutta, <a href="../dn/dn15.html#content">DN15</a> Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical implications.</span></span></span> Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ </p>

It is mostly used in investigating causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense of “reflection, inquiry, attention”.</span></span></span> ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here begins the sequence of dependent origination. I give basic definitions of terms here, and more details in <a href="../dn/dn15.html">DN15</a>.

<p id="dn14:2.18.8"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.8</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a requirement for rebirth?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Since there cannot be an end to the “birth” that starts this life, <i lang="pi" translate="no">jāti</i> means “rebirth”, the next stage in the ongoing cycle.</span></span></span> Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī penetrated with wisdom, ‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Bhava</i> means “being, existence, life” in the sense of “past and future lives”. It refers to the ongoing process of continued existence, transmigrating through life after life. By itself, <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhava</i> has a positive connotation, and represents the longing that many people have to continue to exist after death in a permanent and happy state. The Buddha, however, situates it as just one more dimension of the flow of conditions.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.12"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.12</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there continued existence?

Grasping has the active sense of “taking up” a new life, not just “clinging” to what one has. It has a dual sense, because it also means the “fuel” that sustains the fire of existence.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.16"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.16</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there grasping?

Feeling is a requirement for craving.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Feeling” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vedanā</i>) is more fundamental than the complex concept of “emotion”. It refers to the hedonic tone of experience as pleasant, painful, or neutral.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.24"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.24</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there feeling? What is a requirement for feeling?’ Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī penetrated with wisdom, ‘When contact exists there’s feeling. Contact is a requirement for feeling.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Contact” is literally “touch” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">phassa</i>), and refers to the stimulation that occurs when sense object meets sense organ in experience.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.28"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.28</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there contact?

The six sense fields are requirements for contact.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The five senses with the mind as sixth. This topic is treated extensively throughout early Buddhism, with a special focus on understanding and restraining the pull of sense stimulation. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Āyatana</i> has a root sense “stretch”, from which derived senses include “dimension”, “field”, etc.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.32"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.32</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists are there the six sense fields? What is a requirement for the six sense fields?’ Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī penetrated with wisdom, ‘When name and form exist there are the six sense fields. Name and form are requirements for the six sense fields.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Name and form” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nāmarūpa</i>) is a Vedic concept referring to the multiplicity of material forms (<i lang="pi" translate="no">rūpa</i>) and associated names (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nāma</i>), especially the individual “sentient organisms” such as gods and humans (Rig Veda 5.43.10, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.6.1, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.3.2), which are ultimately absorbed into the divine, like rivers in the ocean (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.2.8, Praśna Upaniṣad 6.5). The Buddha treated “name” analytically as feeling, perception, intention, contact, and application of mind, and “form” as the four elements and derived matter (<a href="../dn/dn15.html#namarupa">DN15</a>, <a href="../mn/mn9.html#namarupa">MN9</a>, and <a href="../sn/sn12.2.html#namarupa">SN12.2</a>).</span></span></span></p>

Consciousness is a requirement for name and form.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>) is simple subjective awareness, the sense of knowing. It arises stimulated by either an external sense impression or a mental phenomena such as thought, memory, etc. It is the subjective awareness that makes the entire multiform world of concepts and appearances possible. Thus far the analysis agrees with Yājñavalkya, who says that the manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.18.40"><span class="parno">dn14:2.18.40</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a requirement for consciousness?’ Then, through rational application of mind, Vipassī penetrated with wisdom, ‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are requirements for consciousness.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha decisively departs from Yājñavalkya’s view that individuated awareness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā</i>) returns into “this great reality, infinite, unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">idaṁ mahadbhūtam anantam apāraṁ vijñānaghana eva</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12). Consciousness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>) is not a fundamental reality (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahadbhūta</i>) underlying multiplicity, but rather a conditioned process that exists only together with name and form.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn14:2.19.1"><span class="parno">dn14:2.19.1</span>Then Vipassī thought, ‘This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Dependent origination normally continues with two further factors: choices and ignorance. The full series does not appear in the Dīghanikāya. This truncated series emphasizes the mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude the normal linear series. Each presentation of dependent origination reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process.</span></span></span> This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: Name and form are requirements for consciousness. Consciousness is a requirement for name and form. Name and form are requirements for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are requirements for contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling. Feeling is a requirement for craving. Craving is a requirement for grasping. Grasping is a requirement for continued existence. Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth. Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the meaning in their own experience.</span></span></span> That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’ </p>

The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers, he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice (<a href="../dn/dn5.html#sacrifice">DN5</a>).

Khaṇḍa was Vipassī’s brother, and the priest’s son was virtually family.</span></span></span> Why don’t I teach them first of all? They will quickly understand this teaching.’ </p>



<p id="dn14:3.9.1"><span class="parno">dn14:3.9.1</span>Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital city of Bandhumatī, in the deer park named Sanctuary.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Khema</i> (“sanctuary”) originally meant “oasis”.

<p id="dn14:3.11.1"><span class="parno">dn14:3.11.1</span>The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven.

Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa: ‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’ </p>



<p id="dn14:3.12.1"><span class="parno">dn14:3.12.1</span>They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma.

And they heard that the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa had shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s presence. It occurred to them, ‘This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth in which the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa have gone forth.

<p id="dn14:3.22.1"><span class="parno">dn14:3.22.1</span>Now at that time a large Saṅgha of 6,800,000 mendicants were residing at Bandhumatī.

<p id="dn14:3.24.1"><span class="parno">dn14:3.24.1</span>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants, telling them all that had happened. Then he said, </p>

He had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. He had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements. He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. His father was King Bandhumā, his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named Bandhumatī.

You were awakened at the root of a peepal tree. You have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna. You have had one gathering of disciples—1,250 mendicants who had ended their defilements. You have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda. Your father was King Suddhodana, your birth mother was Queen Māyā, and your capital city was Kapilavatthu.
