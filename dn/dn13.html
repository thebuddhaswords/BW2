<div lang="en">

<p id="dn13:1.1"><span class="parno">dn13:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Manasākaṭa is mentioned only here.</span></span></span> He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Aciravatī is called Rapti today. It was one of the great rivers that flowed from the Himalayas through Kosala into the Ganges.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:2.1"><span class="parno">dn13:2.1</span>Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:3.1"><span class="parno">dn13:3.1</span>Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding what is the path and what is not the path.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Similar discussions are found in <a href="../mn/mn98.html#content">MN98</a> = <a href="../snp/snp3.9.html#content">Snp3.9</a> and <a href="../dn/dn27.html#content">DN27</a>. <br> The compound <i lang="pi" translate="no">maggāmagga</i> can be read either as “what is the path and what is not the path” (per commentary, <i lang="pi" translate="no">magge ca amagge ca</i>), or as “the variety of paths” (compare <i lang="pi" translate="no">phalāphala</i>, “all sorts of fruit”). Here, however, they are concerned to distinguish one path as correct.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:4.1"><span class="parno">dn13:4.1</span>Vāseṭṭha said this: “This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This must have been earlier than Pokkharasāti’s conversion at <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:2.22.1">DN3</a>. Pokkharasāti was a family man who denied the reality of superhuman meditative attainments (<a href="../mn/mn99.html#pokkharasati1">MN99</a>) and emphasized ethics and duties over lineage (<a href="../mn/mn98.html#content">MN98</a>), which agrees with him being cited on ethical matters at Āpastamba Dharmasūtra 1.6.19.7 and 1.10.28. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Brahmasahabyatā</i> does not mean “union with Brahmā” but rather “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue”. The non-dualist concept that the limited personal self merges with the cosmic divinity is expressed in Pali, rather, with such phrases as <i lang="pi" translate="no">so attā so loko</i> (“the self is identical with the cosmos”). <br> For <i lang="pi" translate="no">añjasa</i> (“direct route”) see <a href="../sn/sn12.65.html#anjasa">SN12.65</a> and note.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:5.1"><span class="parno">dn13:5.1</span>Bhāradvāja said this: “This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. He evidently advocated that lineage rather than conduct made one a brahmin (<a href="../mn/mn98.html#content">MN98</a>). There is a Tārukṣya whose view was that union (with Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other brahmins (Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19). In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa, the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows, thus locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:6.1"><span class="parno">dn13:6.1</span>But neither was able to persuade the other. </p>

<p>So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, “Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:7.7"><span class="parno">dn13:7.7</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. What is the Path and What is Not the Path </h3>



<p id="dn13:8.1"><span class="parno">dn13:8.1</span>So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding: “In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:9.1"><span class="parno">dn13:9.1</span>“So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti, while Bhāradvāja says that the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha. But what exactly is your disagreement about?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:10.1"><span class="parno">dn13:10.1</span>“About what is the path and what is not the path, worthy Gotama. Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Identified by Wijesekera (<em>A Pali Reference to Brāhmaṇa-Caraṇas</em>, Adyar Library Bulletin, vol 20, 1956; reprinted in <em>Buddhist and Vedic Studies</em>) and Jayatilleke (<em>Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</em>, p. 480). I use the familiar Sanskrit forms, as the Pali has several dubious spellings and variants. Their texts and corresponding Vedas are respectively: Adhvaryu = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; White Yajur Veda); Taittirīya = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (Black Yajur Veda); Chāndogya = Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa (Sāman Veda); Cāndrāyaṇa (omitted from MS edition) = Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; spelling established by Wijesekera; see below; Bahvṛca = Bahvṛca Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki.) This is the only time the Pali canon mentions these schools, but in some cases we can identify them with brahmins in the canon. Examples include the murmuring Chāndogya brahmin (<a href="../ud/ud1.4.html#content">Ud1.4</a>); or the Buddha’s former teachers, who evidently hailed from the Addhariya tradition of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. <br> Jayatilleke notes that the Śatapatha describes its own adherents as Adhvaryu (<i lang="pi" translate="no">addhariyā</i>), those priests of the Yajur Veda responsible for the physical acts at the ritual. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.5.2.20 and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.5.6–10 list the Adhvaryu, Chandoga, and  Bahvṛca, thus including the same schools in the same order, except the Pali has split the Yajur and Rig followers into two.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:10.3"><span class="parno">dn13:10.3</span>It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Earlier they were arguing over which one of the paths was correct, whereas now they have shifted to a more universalist “many roads up the same mountain” position. When speaking with each other they saw each others’ views as contradictory, but when speaking with an outsider they adopted a more conciliatory position.</span></span></span> In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha </h3>



<p id="dn13:11.1"><span class="parno">dn13:11.1</span>“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” </p>



<p id="dn13:11.2"><span class="parno">dn13:11.2</span>“I do, worthy Gotama.” </p>

<p id="dn13:12.7"><span class="parno">dn13:12.7</span>“Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?” </p>



<p id="dn13:12.8"><span class="parno">dn13:12.8</span>“No, worthy Gotama.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:13.1"><span class="parno">dn13:13.1</span>“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. <br> Aṭṭhaka = Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vāmaka = Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva = Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Vessāmitta = Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Yamadaggi = Jamadagni Bhārgava, a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgīrasa = Aṅgirasa, identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bhāradvāja = Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vāseṭṭha = Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kassapa = Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhagu = Bhṛgu, the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gṛtsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).</span></span></span> Did they say: ‘We know and see where the Divinity is or what way he lies’?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Unlike the Buddhist monk at <a href="../dn/dn11.html#question">DN11</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:13.4"><span class="parno">dn13:13.4</span>“No, worthy Gotama.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:14.1"><span class="parno">dn13:14.1</span>“So it seems that none of those brahmins have seen the Divinity with their own eyes, and not even the ancient seers claimed to know where he is. Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say: ‘We teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor see. This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity.’ </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn13:14.10"><span class="parno">dn13:14.10</span>What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“No demonstrable basis” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">appāṭihīrakataṁ</i>.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:14.12"><span class="parno">dn13:14.12</span>“Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:15.1"><span class="parno">dn13:15.1</span>“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. </p>



<p id="dn13:15.2"><span class="parno">dn13:15.2</span>Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “blind following the blind” is also at <a href="../mn/mn95.html#blind">MN95</a> and <a href="../mn/mn99.html#blind">MN99</a>. Maitrī Upaniṣad 7.8–9 turns it around, saying that the blind teach false doctrines aimed at destroying the Vedas, “the doctrine of not-self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nairātmyavāda</i>), an obvious reference to Buddhists. We also find it at Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.5, Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.2.8, Mahābhārata 2.38.3, and the Jain Sūyagaḍa 1.1.2.19.</span></span></span> In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn13:16.1"><span class="parno">dn13:16.1</span>What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they pray to them and exalt them, following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kuṣītaka worshiped the rising and setting sun and moon, turning himself to follow their course (Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad 2.7–9). He founded the Kauṣītaki lineage, referred to above as “those who follow the course of the moon” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">cāndrāyaṇa</i>).</span></span></span></p>

Six are shared with the Pali: Brahma is first, from whom derive Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Yama, and Īsāna. Even the names that are not in common might arise from flawed transmission: Parjanya there is perhaps Pajāpati here; Rudra (or Shiva) would be well-described by Mahiddhi (“he of great power”); Mṛtyu (death) may have merged with Yama. If this connection is admitted, it would seem the Buddha is making a sly dig. Those who proclaim themselves to be true brahmins are prostrating themselves to those powers among the gods who, with the exception of Brahma himself, are in fact aristocrats (<i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i>), not brahmins at all. The Upaniṣad draws attention to the <i lang="pi" translate="no">rājasūya</i> coronation, at which the brahmin sits beneath the aristocrat. Further, Indra, Pajāpati, Varuṇa, and Īsāna are also invoked in the martial exhortation at <a href="../sn/sn11.3.html#content">SN11.3</a>, cementing their status as aristocrat warriors.</span></span></span> ‘We call upon Indra!

He was also identified with Rudra and Śiva. <br> Pajāpati (“progenitor”) was the lonely god of creation (“Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us”, Rig Veda 10.85.3). The heat of his fervent exertions (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tapas</i>) created the world and all things in it (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6). <br> Brahmā, like Pajāpati, is also a creator god, but is the divine power immanent within creation, rather than the forgotten instigator of the past. <br> The Mahāsaṅgīti reading Mahiddhi (“he of great power”) is not a regular name for a deity, but as noted above, he may be Rudra/Shiva, regarded as the chief deity of psychic powers. The BJT reads Mahinda (Sanskrit Mahendra), the “Great Indra”, said to be a title of Indra bestowed after slaying the dragon Vṛtra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.4.9). <br> Yama (“twin”, with his incestuous sister Yamī) was born immortal but chose mortality, becoming the god of the dead.</span></span></span></p>

Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja later applied to ordain, in which time the Buddha taught the full path to Nibbana.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn13:82.1"><span class="parno">dn13:82.1</span>When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him, “Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. </p>

<hr>

<p>We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> According to the commentary, that was the first time they went for refuge, while this was the second time. This makes sense in terms of the progress of the teachings, for there they discuss what makes a brahmin, whereas here they ask the more subtle question how to achieve rebirth with Brahmā. The discussion, too, is on a more detailed level, with a more explicit criticism of the brahmins. Nonetheless, it is difficult to square the details of the narratives, for the opening of this sutta depicts Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja speaking about the Buddha by reputation rather than as devotees who have previously met him and gone for refuge.</span></span></span> From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>
