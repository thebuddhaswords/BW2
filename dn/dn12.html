<h3>DN12: Lohicca Sutta – With Lohicca </h3>

<div id="metaarea">

</div>

<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="dn12:1.1"><span class="parno">dn12:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the only appearance of a place called Sālavatikā (“Abounding in Sal Trees”). A courtesan of Rājagaha named Sālavatī appears in <a href="../vi/kd8.html#salavati">Khandhaka 8</a>; she might perhaps have come from there.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:1.3"><span class="parno">dn12:1.3</span>Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A certain brahmin Lohicca also appears in <a href="../sn/sn35.132.html#content">SN35.132</a>. But since that is set far away in Avantī after the Buddha’s passing, and since in both cases he is said to have taken refuge, it seems likely these are different people.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:2.1"><span class="parno">dn12:2.1</span>Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception: “Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A similar view is sometimes unjustly imputed to the Theravādins, that they are only interested in their own liberation.</span></span></span> Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:3.1"><span class="parno">dn12:3.1</span>Lohicca heard: </p>



<p id="dn12:3.2"><span class="parno">dn12:3.2</span>“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:4.1"><span class="parno">dn12:4.1</span>Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While <i lang="pi" translate="no">nhāpita</i> would seem to be identical with <i lang="pi" translate="no">nhāpaka</i> (“bathroom attendant”), it is usually translated per Jataka 395 where it means “barber”.</span></span></span> “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then ask him whether he, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note the unusual use of <i lang="pi" translate="no">kira</i> in this idiom, found in <a href="../sn/sn35.133.html#content">SN35.133</a>, <a href="../mn/mn85.html#content">MN85</a>, <a href="../mn/mn127.html#content">MN127</a>, and <a href="../ud/ud2.8.html#kira">Ud2.8</a>. I think this expresses polite deference, and render with “might” rather than “would”.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:5.1"><span class="parno">dn12:5.1</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha consented with silence. </p>



<p id="dn12:6.1"><span class="parno">dn12:6.1</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him, “I gave the Buddha your message, and he accepted.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:7.1"><span class="parno">dn12:7.1</span>And when the night had passed Lohicca had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying: ‘It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.’” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:7.4"><span class="parno">dn12:7.4</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:7.7"><span class="parno">dn12:7.7</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha, and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding, “Sir, please dissuade him from that harmful misconception.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It seems the barber was not only a trusted confidant, but an intelligent man with sincere concern for Lohicca’s well being.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:8.10"><span class="parno">dn12:8.10</span>“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha is modest as to his chances.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:9.1"><span class="parno">dn12:9.1</span>Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. Questioning Lohicca </h3>



<p id="dn12:9.4"><span class="parno">dn12:9.4</span>When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>



<p id="dn12:9.5"><span class="parno">dn12:9.5</span>The Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, Lohicca, that you have such a harmful misconception:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha takes the initiative. “Harmful misconception” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāpakaṁ diṭṭhigataṁ</i>.</span></span></span> ‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’” </p>



<p id="dn12:9.10"><span class="parno">dn12:9.10</span>“Yes, worthy Gotama.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:10.1"><span class="parno">dn12:10.1</span>“What do you think, Lohicca? Do you reside in Sālavatikā?” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.3"><span class="parno">dn12:10.3</span>“Yes, worthy Gotama.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:10.4"><span class="parno">dn12:10.4</span>“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: ‘The brahmin Lohicca resides in Sālavatikā. He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else.’ Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:10.8"><span class="parno">dn12:10.8</span>“They would, worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.9"><span class="parno">dn12:10.9</span>“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.10"><span class="parno">dn12:10.10</span>“Unkindly, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.11"><span class="parno">dn12:10.11</span>“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.12"><span class="parno">dn12:10.12</span>“Hostility, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.13"><span class="parno">dn12:10.13</span>“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.14"><span class="parno">dn12:10.14</span>“Wrong view, worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn12:10.15"><span class="parno">dn12:10.15</span>“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:11.1"><span class="parno">dn12:11.1</span>What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsi and Kosala?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kosala is the native realm of Pasenadi. Kāsi had formerly been an independent kingdom, but was taken over by Pasenadi’s father Mahākosala. Towards the end of the Buddha’s life it was contested between Kosala and Magadha (<a href="../sn/sn3.14.html#content">SN3.14</a>, <a href="../sn/sn3.15.html#content">SN3.15</a>). Ultimately it became part of the greater Magadhan empire.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn12:11.3"><span class="parno">dn12:11.3</span>“Yes, worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.4"><span class="parno">dn12:11.4</span>“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: ‘King Pasenadi reigns over Kāsi and Kosala. He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsi and Kosala and not share them with anyone else.’ Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:11.8"><span class="parno">dn12:11.8</span>“They would, worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.9"><span class="parno">dn12:11.9</span>“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.10"><span class="parno">dn12:11.10</span>“Unkindly, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.11"><span class="parno">dn12:11.11</span>“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.12"><span class="parno">dn12:11.12</span>“Hostility, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.13"><span class="parno">dn12:11.13</span>“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.14"><span class="parno">dn12:11.14</span>“Wrong view, worthy Gotama.” </p>



<p id="dn12:11.15"><span class="parno">dn12:11.15</span>“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:12.1"><span class="parno">dn12:12.1</span>So it seems, Lohicca, that should someone say such a thing either of Lohicca or of King Pasenadi, that is wrong view. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:13.3"><span class="parno">dn12:13.3</span>In the same way, suppose someone were to say: ‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn12:13.7"><span class="parno">dn12:13.7</span>Now, there are gentlemen who, relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, achieve a high distinction such as the following: they realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-return, the fruit of non-return, or perfection. And in addition, there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state. The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them. They’re acting unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is only through sharing what good things we know that we can support each other.</span></span></span> An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Three Teachers Who Deserve to Be Reprimanded </h3>



<p id="dn12:16.1"><span class="parno">dn12:16.1</span>Lohicca, there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Even though he has characterized Lohicca’s view as harmful, the Buddha goes out of his way to show that it is not entirely wrong. There are cases where it is best to avoid teaching.</span></span></span> When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, correct, legitimate, and blameless. What three? </p>



<p id="dn12:16.4"><span class="parno">dn12:16.4</span>Firstly, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. It’s like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away, or embraces her though she turns her back.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The genders of this passage are made clear through the use of feminine nouns. Making unwelcome advances was seen as an obvious example of something wrong.</span></span></span> That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ This is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>



<p id="dn12:17.1"><span class="parno">dn12:17.1</span>Furthermore, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ Their disciples do want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At <a href="../dn/dn29.html#vattati">DN29</a> the opposite sense is expressed as <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādāya taṁ dhammaṁ vattati</i>.</span></span></span> That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples they don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. It’s like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone else’s field. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ This is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>



<p id="dn12:18.1"><span class="parno">dn12:18.1</span>Furthermore, take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you have reached the goal of the ascetic life; yet when you teach disciples they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha adopts Lohicca’s formulation, but applies it in a specific sense, not as a generalization.</span></span></span> That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ This is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>
