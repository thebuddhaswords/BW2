<h3>1. On the Brahmin Emissaries </h3>

<p id="dn6:1.1"><span class="parno">dn6:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Lying some 60 kilometers north of Pāṭaliputra (Patna), Vesālī was the largest city in the Vajji Federation, a republican league in the region north of the Ganges.</span></span></span> Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the earlier suttas of this chapter, we have seen how news of the Buddha spread, evidently following Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Here we see an example of the kind of meeting at which such news would be discussed. <br> The phrase “brahmin emissaries” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brāhmaṇadūtā</i>) does not seem to occur elsewhere and is not explained in the commentary. Perhaps they were emissaries of the kings, meeting in a neutral location. Or perhaps they were emissaries of their respective communities of brahmins.</span></span></span> They heard: </p>



<p id="dn6:1.5"><span class="parno">dn6:1.5</span>“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This monastery features prominently as the Buddha’s usual place of residence near Vesālī.</span></span></span> He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:2.1"><span class="parno">dn6:2.1</span>Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn6:2.2"><span class="parno">dn6:2.2</span>Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said, “Worthy Nāgita, where is the worthy Gotama at present? For we want to see him.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:2.6"><span class="parno">dn6:2.6</span>“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">At some times the Buddha would go on retreat and ask that no-one visit him except to bring food; this sometimes happened at the Great Wood (<a href="../sn/sn54.9.html#content">SN54.9</a>). He also had the habit of withdrawing into the wood itself for meditation (<a href="../an/an5.58.html#content">AN5.58</a>). At this time, however, he was simply staying in a nearby hut, so it seems Nāgita is being over-zealous.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn6:2.7"><span class="parno">dn6:2.7</span>So right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side, thinking, “We’ll go only after we’ve seen the worthy Gotama.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi </h3>



<p id="dn6:3.1"><span class="parno">dn6:3.1</span>Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Oṭṭhaddha mean “hare-lip” and is evidently a nickname or epithet. Throughout, the Buddha refers to him by his personal name, Mahāli. And it is under that name we meet him again in <a href="../sn/sn11.13.html#content">SN11.13</a>, <a href="../sn/sn22.60.html#content">SN22.60</a>, and <a href="../an/an10.47.html#content">AN10.47</a>. <br> The Licchavis, whose name is derived from “bear”, dominated the Vajji Federation. Note that the Mahāsaṅgīti edition here spells the masculine singular as <i lang="pi" translate="no">licchavī</i>, whereas normally it is <i lang="pi" translate="no">licchavi</i>.</span></span></span> “Worthy Nāgita, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? For we want to see him.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:3.4"><span class="parno">dn6:3.4</span>“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.” </p>



<p id="dn6:3.5"><span class="parno">dn6:3.5</span>So right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side, thinking, “I’ll go only after I’ve seen the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” </p>



<p id="dn6:4.1"><span class="parno">dn6:4.1</span>Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This Sīha is unknown elsewhere.</span></span></span> “Honorable Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kassapa is Nāgita’s clan name; either he was a brahmin or a <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiya</i> whose family chaplain (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>) was a Kassapa.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn6:4.3"><span class="parno">dn6:4.3</span>“Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In trying to protect the Buddha, Nāgita was inflexible and lacking compassion. When given good advice by Sīha, he responded gracelessly, fobbing off responsibility to a junior. No wonder he was replaced by Ānanda.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:4.4"><span class="parno">dn6:4.4</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding: “Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:4.7"><span class="parno">dn6:4.7</span>“Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:4.8"><span class="parno">dn6:4.8</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so. </p>



<p id="dn6:4.9"><span class="parno">dn6:4.9</span>Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is still a common place for forest monks to receive guests.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the last we hear of these emissaries.</span></span></span> When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. </p>



<p id="dn6:5.3"><span class="parno">dn6:5.3</span>Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sunakkhatta features in several suttas, through which his journey may be traced. In <a href="../mn/mn105.html#content">MN105</a> he meets the Buddha and gains faith; here in <a href="../dn/dn6.html#content">DN6</a> he is becoming dissatisfied; in <a href="../dn/dn24.html#rejected">DN24</a> he rejects the Buddha; and in <a href="../mn/mn12.html#content">MN12</a> he attacks the Buddha after disrobing.</span></span></span> ‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to “clairvoyance” and “clairaudience”, sometimes translated as the “divine eye” and “divine ear”. Despite being included in the Gradual Training, they are not a goal of Buddhist practice. Rather, they are unnecessary but potentially useful, as they reveal dimensions of being inaccessible to ordinary consciousness. Sunakkhatta, however, was evidently just interested in having pleasant supersensory experiences.</span></span></span> The heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear: do such sounds really exist or not?” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. One-Sided Immersion </h4>



<p id="dn6:5.7"><span class="parno">dn6:5.7</span>“Such sounds really do exist, but Sunakkhatta cannot hear them.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This must have wounded his pride.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn6:6.1"><span class="parno">dn6:6.1</span>“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them, even though they really do exist?” </p>



<p id="dn6:6.2"><span class="parno">dn6:6.2</span>“Mahāli, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the eastern quarter in one aspect: so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This description of meditation is unique in the Pali canon. The Buddha answers Mahāli’s question directly, even though the premise betrays Sunakkhatta’s limited understanding. When a questioner is sincere, answering directly shows respect and builds trust.</span></span></span> When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they see heavenly sights but don’t hear heavenly sounds. </p>

<hr>

<p>Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:7.1"><span class="parno">dn6:7.1</span>Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the southern quarter in one aspect … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:8.1"><span class="parno">dn6:8.1</span>Take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the eastern quarter in one aspect: so as to hear heavenly sounds but not to see heavenly sights. When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they hear heavenly sounds but don’t see heavenly sights. </p>

<p>Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:9.1"><span class="parno">dn6:9.1</span>Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the southern quarter in one aspect … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:10.1"><span class="parno">dn6:10.1</span>Take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the eastern quarter in both aspects: so as to hear heavenly sounds and see heavenly sights. When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds. Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:11.1"><span class="parno">dn6:11.1</span>Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed immersion to the southern quarter in both aspects … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. This is the cause, Mahāli, this is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, even though they really do exist.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:12.1"><span class="parno">dn6:12.1</span>“Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:12.2"><span class="parno">dn6:12.2</span>“No, Mahāli, the mendicants don’t lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Having directly answered the original question, the Buddha reframed the issue on request.</span></span></span> There are other things that are finer, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Four Noble Fruits </h4>



<p id="dn6:13.1"><span class="parno">dn6:13.1</span>“But sir, what are those finer things?” </p>



<p id="dn6:13.2"><span class="parno">dn6:13.2</span>“Firstly, Mahāli, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the first description of the four stages of awakening which are featured throughout the Pali canon. The three fetters are identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances (<a href="../mn/mn2.html#3fetters">MN2</a>).</span></span></span> This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me. </p>



<p id="dn6:13.4"><span class="parno">dn6:13.4</span>Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This too is one of the finer things. </p>



<p id="dn6:13.6"><span class="parno">dn6:13.6</span>Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The five lower fetters are the three mentioned above, plus sensual desire and ill will (<a href="../an/an10.13.html#">AN10.13</a>). This is the non-returner, who spends their last life in an exalted Brahmā realm. Compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.15.1: one who lives properly “attains the Brahmā realm and does not return again” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmalokam abhisaṃpadyate na ca punar āvartate</i>) <br> A “spontaneous” rebirth is one that occurs without gestation in the womb, like most <i lang="pi" translate="no">devas</i>, or for that matter, Boltzmann brains.</span></span></span> This too is one of the finer things. </p>



<p id="dn6:13.8"><span class="parno">dn6:13.8</span>Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the arahant, the “worthy” or “perfected” one. Elsewhere it is said they abandon the five higher fetters: desire for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, desire for rebirth in the formless realm, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance (<a href="../an/an10.13.html#content">AN10.13</a>).</span></span></span> This too is one of the finer things. </p>



<p id="dn6:13.10"><span class="parno">dn6:13.10</span>These are the finer things, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.” </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Noble Eightfold Path </h4>



<p id="dn6:14.1"><span class="parno">dn6:14.1</span>“But, sir, is there a path and a practice for realizing these things?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:14.2"><span class="parno">dn6:14.2</span>“There is, Mahāli.” </p>



<p id="dn6:14.3"><span class="parno">dn6:14.3</span>“Well, what is it?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn6:14.4"><span class="parno">dn6:14.4</span>“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the most fundamental of the Buddha’s teachings on the path, declared in his first sermon (<a href="../sn/sn56.11.html#content">SN56.11</a>).

Realization of the Dhamma completes the circle by deepening conceptual right view to liberating insight.

<h4 class="subheading">2.4. On the Two Renunciates </h4>



<p id="dn6:15.1"><span class="parno">dn6:15.1</span>This one time, Mahāli, I was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha retells the events recorded in the next sutta, <a href="../dn/dn7.html">DN7</a>.</span></span></span> Then two renunciates—the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic—came and exchanged greetings with me.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Muṇḍiya means “bald one”; his name is spelled Mandissa in some manuscripts. He appears only in this passage. Jāliya returns in <a href="../dn/dn24.html#jaliva">DN24</a>, which recounts the farcical events following Sunakkhatta’s disrobal. There he takes the Buddha’s part against the delusional Pāṭikaputta favored by Sunakkhatta.</span></span></span> When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to me: ‘Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body one and the same, or is the soul one thing, the body another?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The term “soul” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jīva</i>) was favored by the <i lang="pi" translate="no">samaṇas</i>, as opposed to the “self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">attā</i>) of the brahmins. Both are rejected by the Buddha as forms of “metaphysical” self: they postulate the absolute, eternal existence of entities that cannot be established empirically. The repeated demonstrative pronouns (<i lang="pi" translate="no">taṁ jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ</i>) assert an emphatic identity.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn6:16.3"><span class="parno">dn6:16.3</span>I said this: ‘Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … </p>

Faced with the end of all rebirth, however, no theory of eternal self can stand.</span></span></span></p>
