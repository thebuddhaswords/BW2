<div lang="en">
<p id="dn3:1.1.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.1.1</span>So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta marks a turning point where the Buddha’s teachings were embraced by the leading brahmin Pokkharasāti. The suttas that follow reverberate with the consequences of this encounter. He was one of the most influential brahmins of his time, although the Buddha elsewhere denied that he had any special knowledge (<a href="../mn/mn99.html#pokkharasati1">MN99.10</a>). Brahmanical texts confirm that he was a real person, an influential teacher around the time of the Buddha known as Pauṣkarasādi in Sanskrit. He is cited on grammar by Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and in the Taittirīya-prātiśākhya; on allowable food and theft in the Āpastamba Dharmasūtra; and on Vedic ritual in the Śāṅkhāyana-Āraṇyaka. His name identifies him as descended from a man of Puṣkarāvati, capital of Gandhāra. <a href="../mn/mn99.html#pokkharasati2">MN99.10</a> also clarifies that he is of the Upamañña lineage.</span></span></span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Icchānaṅgala was a center east of Sāvatthī for the innovative brahmins of the Kosala region.</span></span></span> He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. The Section on Pokkharasāti </h3>



<p id="dn3:1.2.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.2.1</span>Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ukkaṭṭhā is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins (<a href="../dn/dn14.html#ukkattha">DN14.178</a>, <a href="../mn/mn1.html#content">MN1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn49.html#content">MN49</a>). Sanskrit sources call it a <i lang="pi" translate="no">droṇamukha</i>, a leading market town accessible by land and water (Divyāvadāna 319.010). At <a href="../mn/mn99.html#pokkharasati2">MN99</a> Pokkharasāti is said to be “of the Subhaga Forest”. <br> “Royal park” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">rājadāya</i> (cp. <i lang="pi" translate="no">migadāya</i>, “deer park”). <br> A <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmadeyya</i> is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Pokkharasāti heard: </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:1.2.3"><span class="parno">dn3:1.2.3</span>“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Contrast with his rejection of this possibility at <a href="../mn/mn99.html#10.7">MN 99:10.7</a>.</span></span></span> He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pokkharasāti does not care whether the Buddha identified as a follower of the Vedas. The wise do not concern themselves with religious identity.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. The Student Ambaṭṭha </h3>



<p id="dn3:1.3.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.3.1</span>Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha as his resident pupil. He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Cosmology” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">lokāyata</i>) in early Buddhist texts is not, as it later became known, the heterodox school of materialism. Rather, it was a branch of worldly knowledge within regular Vedic studies concerned with the nature and extent of the world and how this may be known (<a href="../an/an9.38.html#content">AN9.38</a>, <a href="../sn/sn12.48.html#content">SN12.48</a>; cf. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.3.1).</span></span></span> and the marks of a great man. He had been authorized as a master <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Authorized as a master” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anuññātapaṭiññāta</i>) see <a href="../mn/mn98.html#authorised">MN98</a> and <a href="../snp/snp3.9.html#authorised">Snp3.9</a>.</span></span></span> in his own tutor’s scriptural heritage <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> For “scriptural heritage of the three Vedas” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tevijjake pāvacane</i>) see <a href="../mn/mn95.html#scriptural_heritage">MN95</a>.</span></span></span> of the three Vedas with the words:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Vocabularies” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">nighaṇḍu</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nighaṇṭu</i>), known from the Nirukta of Yāska. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Keṭubha</i> lacks an obvious Sanskrit form. The commentary explains, “The study of proper and improper actions for the assistance of poets.” This suggests a connection with ritual performance, which is the special area of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. There we often find phrases such as <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṛtam bhavati</i>, “it is performed”, of which <i lang="pi" translate="no">keṭubha</i> is perhaps a contraction. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Akkhara</i> (literally “syllable”) is explained by the commentary as <i lang="pi" translate="no">sikkhā</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">śikṣā</i>), which is the study of pronunciation. This can be traced back to Pāṇinī, and is sometimes referred to as <i lang="pi" translate="no">akṣara-samāmnāya</i>, “collation of syllables”. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Pabheda</i> is found in Buddhist Sanskrit texts as <i lang="pi" translate="no">padaprabheda</i>, “classification of words”, such as into the different parts of speech. The commentary identifies it with <i lang="pi" translate="no">nirutti</i>. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Padaka</i> is one skilled in the <i lang="pi" translate="no">padapāṭha</i> recitation of Vedas, which separates the individual words. <br> For “testaments” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">itihāsa</i>) see <i lang="pi" translate="no">itihāsa-purāṇa</i> in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.6.8, explained by the commentator there as legends of creation and olden times (see also Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.1.4).</span></span></span>  “What I know, you know.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Almost the same words are spoken to the bodhisatta by his first teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta (<a href="../mn/mn36.html#realised">MN36</a>). This connects Pokkharasāti with Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and suggests that the anointing of a talented student in this way was a regular practice of wise brahmins.</span></span></span> And what you know, I know.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:1.4.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.4.1</span>Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha, “Dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. He has this good reputation … It’s good to see such perfected ones. Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation. Through you I shall learn about the worthy Gotama.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Following PTS and BJT editions of the parallel phrase at <a href="../mn/mn91.html#learn">MN91</a>, which read <i lang="pi" translate="no">tayā</i> for <i lang="pi" translate="no">tathā</i>.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:1.5.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.5.1</span>“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:1.5.2"><span class="parno">dn3:1.5.2</span>“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The thirty-two marks are detailed in <a href="../dn/dn14.html#32marks">DN14</a>, <a href="../dn/dn30.html#content">DN30</a>, and <a href="../mn/mn91.html#content">MN91</a>. In Buddhist texts they are presented as the fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecy, but they are not found in any Brahmanical texts of the Buddha’s time. However, later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa (1st century BCE?) and Bṛhatsaṁhitā (6th century CE?) contain references to many of these marks, albeit in a different context, so it seems likely the Buddhist texts are drawing on now-lost Brahmanical scriptures. <br> The notion of a two-fold course for a great hero—worldly success or spiritual—can be traced back as far as the epic of Gilgamesh.</span></span></span> If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The idea of the wheel-turning monarch draws from the Vedic horse sacrifice, which establishes the authority of a king from sea to sea. The Buddhist telling is divested of all coarse and violent elements. The wheeled chariot gave military supremacy to the ancient Indo-Europeans, allowing them to spread from their ancient homeland north of the Black Sea. In Buddhism, the wheel, which also has solar connotations, symbolizes unstoppable power. For a legendary account of such a king, see the Mahāsudassanasutta (<a href="../dn/dn17.html#content">DN 17</a>). Rig Veda 8.63.8 speaks of Indra as the “wheel turner”.</span></span></span> He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sacrificial horse on its journey across the land is protected by a hundred sons.</span></span></span> After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. But, dear Ambaṭṭha, I am the one who gives the hymns,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The relation between Pokkharasāti and Ambaṭṭha is similar to that between the Buddha and his followers. They share the same understanding, but the Buddha is distinguished as the teacher.</span></span></span> and you are the one who receives them.” </p>



<p id="dn3:1.6.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.6.1</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a chariot drawn by mares and, together with several young students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In this sutta, <i lang="pi" translate="no">māṇava</i> is always applied to Ambaṭṭha and <i lang="pi" translate="no">māṇavaka</i> to the rest. It seems that the diminutive <i lang="pi" translate="no">māṇavaka</i> means “young student”. <br> There are said to be <i lang="pi" translate="no">sambahula</i> students, a word that is often translated as “many”. But later we see that they all fit inside the Buddha’s hut, so the sense must be “several”.</span></span></span> He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. </p>



<p id="dn3:1.7.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.7.1</span>At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the practice of walking meditation. Meditators pace mindfully up and down a smooth path, keeping attention on their body.</span></span></span> Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said, “Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Bho</i> is a respectful term of address used by brahmins. The forms of address used in Pali are complex, and it is rarely possible to map them to modern English with any precision.</span></span></span> For we have come here to see him.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The parallel passage at <a href="../mn/mn35.html#cometoseehim">MN35</a> has a different phrase here.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:1.8.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.8.1</span>Then those mendicants thought, “This Ambaṭṭha is from a well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin Pokkharasāti. The Buddha won’t mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The term <i lang="pi" translate="no">kulaputta</i> (literally, “son of a family”) typically refers to someone from a well-to-do or respected family, a “gentleman”. It is a gendered term which assumes the social status of men.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:1.8.4"><span class="parno">dn3:1.8.4</span>They said to Ambaṭṭha, “Ambaṭṭha, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door-panel. The Buddha will open the door.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The introduction has told us that the Buddha was staying in a forest at this time. Nonetheless, this was not a wilderness, but was developed enough to have huts with latched doors.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:1.9.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.9.1</span>So he approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel, and the Buddha opened the door. Ambaṭṭha and the young students entered the dwelling. The young students exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, sat down to one side. But while the Buddha was sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing. </p>



<p id="dn3:1.9.4"><span class="parno">dn3:1.9.4</span>So the Buddha said to him, “Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the tutors of tutors: walking around or standing while I’m sitting, speaking some polite words or other?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha draws attention to Ambaṭṭha’s rude behavior. Throughout the suttas, the manner in which people greet the Buddha gives us a hint as to their attitudes and qualities.</span></span></span></p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The First Use of the Word “Primitives” </h4>



<p id="dn3:1.10.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.10.1</span>“No, worthy Gotama. For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. But as to these shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, I converse with them as I do with the worthy Gotama.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note the racial connotations of using <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇha</i> (“black”) as a slur. The brahmin caste hailed from the (relatively) fair-skinned Indo-Europeans who entered India from the north. Vedic texts indicate that there was Brahmanical prejudice against dark-skinned natives, but also that they were assimilated and raised to positions of honor.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:1.11.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.11.1</span>“But Ambaṭṭha, you must have come here for some purpose. You should focus on that.

<p id="dn3:1.12.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.12.1</span>When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified.

The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">ibbha</i> (“primitive”) stems from a non-Aryan word for “elephant” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ibha</i>). It originally referred to the native inhabitants who tamed elephants; see eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.10. At <a href="../snp/snp3.1.html#native">Snp3.1</a> the Buddha describes his own people as “natives” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">niketino</i>), those who have a long connection with the land.</span></span></span> It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—primitives that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” </p>

Mahābhārata 7.4.5c, 7.132.23a). They were evidently the Abastanians whose rout at the hands of Alexander is recorded by Arrian (<em>The Anabasis of Alexander</em>, chapter 15). They were probably located near what is today the northern Sindh province in Pakistan. Later texts such as Manusmṛti 1.8 say that an <i lang="pi" translate="no">ambaṣṭha</i> is born of a brahmin father and <i lang="pi" translate="no">vaiśya</i> mother.</span></span></span></p>

Since no clan of that name is attested it is perhaps a confusion with the Kāṇvāyanas of Rig Veda 8.55.4. But the confusion, if it is such, has an old history, for Rig Veda 1.117.8 refers to “Dark Kaṇva” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">Śyāva Kaṇva</i>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:1.15.6"><span class="parno">dn3:1.15.6</span>“But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a slavegirl of the Sakyans.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally I take <i lang="pi" translate="no">ayyaputta</i> as a simple honorific, but here the sense is not that the Sakyans were the masters, but were descended from them.</span></span></span> But the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their grandfather.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Okkāka (Sanskrit Ikṣvāku) was the legendary son of the first man, Manu, and the founder of the solar dynasty of Kosala.

<p id="dn3:1.15.8"><span class="parno">dn3:1.15.8</span>Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder princes from the realm—Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sinisūra. They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large grove of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sakhua</i> trees.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The words for “teak” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sāka</i>) and “sal” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sāla</i>) have evidently been confused from the Munda root <i lang="pi" translate="no">sarja</i> (both appear at <a href="../mn/mn93.html#teak">MN93</a>). But teak does not grow so far north, so the sal must be meant here. To maintain the pun I use <i lang="pi" translate="no">sakhua</i>, which is an alternate Hindi name for the sal tree. This story suggests that when they settled in their northern home in the shadow of the Himalayas, harvesting sal was a primary source of wealth. Compare Gilgamesh, for whom Lebanese cedar was the foundation of his royal capital.</span></span></span> For fear of breaking their line of birth, they slept with their own (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saka</i>) sisters.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Own” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">saka</i>, the second pun on the Sakyan name.

<p id="dn3:1.15.12"><span class="parno">dn3:1.15.12</span>Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and councillors, ‘Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For this sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sammati</i>, see <a href="../sn/sn11.9.html#content">SN11.9</a>, <a href="../sn/sn11.10.html#content">SN11.10</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:1.15.14"><span class="parno">dn3:1.15.14</span>‘Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large grove of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sakhua</i> trees.

<p id="dn3:1.15.16"><span class="parno">dn3:1.15.16</span>Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ‘The princes are indeed Sakyans! The princes are indeed the best Sakyans!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This draws on both the puns above. But the commentary also explains <i lang="pi" translate="no">sakya</i> here as “capable” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samatthā</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭibalā</i>) in reference to their survival against all odds, thus connecting Sakya with <i lang="pi" translate="no">sakka</i> (“able”).</span></span></span> From that day on the Sakyans were recognized and he was their founder. </p>



<p id="dn3:1.16.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.16.1</span>Now, King Okkāka had a slavegirl named Disā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vedic <i lang="pi" translate="no">dāsa</i> (“slave, bondservant”) refers to the “dark-wombed” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kṛṣṇayoni</i>, Rig Veda 2.20.7) foes of the Aryan peoples (Rig Veda 10.22.8) who upon defeat were enslaved (Rig Veda 10.62.10). The name <i lang="pi" translate="no">disā</i> therefore probably means “foe” (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">dviṣa</i>).</span></span></span>
 She gave birth to a boy named “Black”.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The passage wavers between treating <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇha</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṛṣṇa</i>, i.e. Krishna) as a personal name, a description, and a word for a goblin. I try to capture this ambiguity by using variations of “black boy”. <br> The passage does not say who the father was. According to Arthaśāstra 3.13, a female slave is protected against sexual harassment by the master, but should she have a child by him, both mother and child are to be set free, and if the sex was not consensual, he must pay her a fine.</span></span></span> When he was born, Black Boy said: ‘Wash me, mum, bathe me! Get this filth off of me! I will be useful for you!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Like Siddhattha, he spoke as soon as he was born. The boy was no common child, but had a larger destiny. His words are a dramatic contrast with Siddhattha’s words of confident proclamation, and his birth which was devoid of filth or impurity.</span></span></span> Whereas these days when people see goblins they recognize them as goblins, in those days they recognized goblins as ‘blackboys’. </p>



<p id="dn3:1.16.7"><span class="parno">dn3:1.16.7</span>They said: ‘He spoke as soon as he was born—a blackboy is born!

That’s how, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a slavegirl of the Sakyans.” </p>



<p id="dn3:1.17.1"><span class="parno">dn3:1.17.1</span>When he said this, those young students said to him, “Worthy Gotama, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a slavegirl.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Lineage was important to brahmins, but the Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad literature shows that, as here, many were more concerned with conduct and wisdom than with birth.</span></span></span> He’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, who enunciates well, and is astute.

<p id="dn3:2.3.11"><span class="parno">dn3:2.3.11</span>Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flame. In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the third cause of quitting this supreme knowledge and conduct. </p>

For example, Bharadvāja is the rishi, the Bhāradvājas are his descendants; Vasiṣṭha is the rishi, the Vāsiṣṭhas are his descendants. Pali texts do not make this distinction, but use the patronymic, although the two forms are not always readily distinguishable. <br> “Seer” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">isi</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">ṛṣi</i>), for which the Proto-Dravidian root <i lang="pi" translate="no">icai</i> (“sing”) has been proposed. It was taken to mean that they had “seen” the Vedas (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mantradraṣṭa</i>) or directly “heard” them from Brahmā through divine inspiration, rather than “composing” them like ordinary authors.

<p>Then Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. </p>



<p id="dn3:2.15.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.15.1</span>Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha, “Oh, our bloody fake scholar, our fake learned man, who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas!

<h3 class="subheading">8. Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha </h3>



<p id="dn3:2.16.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.16.1</span>Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti, “It’s much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama today. You can visit him tomorrow.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Given Pokkharasāti’s mood, this was probably a diplomatic move.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn3:2.16.4"><span class="parno">dn3:2.16.4</span>So Pokkharasāti had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he mounted a carriage and, with attendants carrying torches, set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near Icchānaṅgala.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Khādanīya</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhojanīya</i> are food categories commonly mentioned in Pali.

But it would have included such “crunchy” things as fruit and vegetables, which may be eaten uncooked.</span></span></span> He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. </p>

<hr>

<p>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, </p>

<hr>

<p>“Master Gotama, has my resident pupil, the student Ambaṭṭha, come here?” </p>



<p id="dn3:2.17.3"><span class="parno">dn3:2.17.3</span>“Yes he has, brahmin.” </p>

<p>Then the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:2.17.8"><span class="parno">dn3:2.17.8</span>Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha, </p>

<p>“Ambaṭṭha is a fool, worthy Gotama. Please forgive him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">So far has Ambaṭṭha fallen from the learned sage we were introduced to at the start of the sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn3:2.18.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.18.1</span>Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. He saw all of them except for two, which he had doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. </p>



<p id="dn3:2.18.5"><span class="parno">dn3:2.18.5</span>Then it occurred to the Buddha, “Pokkharasāti sees all the marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.” Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn3:2.19.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.19.1</span>Pokkharasāti thought, “The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” </p>



<p id="dn3:2.19.3"><span class="parno">dn3:2.19.3</span>He said to the Buddha, “Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>



<p id="dn3:2.20.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.20.1</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Pokkharasāti announced the time to him, “It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Robed up” because inside the monastery, monks would normally wear just a lower robe, and would don the upper and (sometimes) outer robes when visiting a layperson’s home.</span></span></span> Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods, while his young students served the Saṅgha. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>



<p id="dn3:2.21.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.21.1</span>Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While all these teachings feature commonly in the suttas, there is no text that depicts this framework in detail.</span></span></span> And when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the briefest expression of the four noble truths.</span></span></span> Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This indicates that he became a stream-enterer (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sotāpanna</i>), the first of four stages of Awakening. Such details of personal attainment are typically found in the narrative rather than the teaching attributed to the Buddha, and hence were added by redactors at some point. They vary considerably in different versions. In this case, the parallel at DA 20 says that he became a stream-enterer and later a non-returner. T 20 said that he understood the teaching and went for refuge, and agrees that he became a non-returner before his death.</span></span></span> “Everything that has a beginning has an end.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the insight into universal impermanence and dependent origination.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">9. Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>



<p id="dn3:2.22.1"><span class="parno">dn3:2.22.1</span>Then Pokkharasāti saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, </p>

<p>“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, just so has the worthy Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways. Together with my children, wives, retinue, and ministers, I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. </p>



<p id="dn3:2.22.6"><span class="parno">dn3:2.22.6</span>Just as the worthy Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā, may he visit mine.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When wandering for alms, mendicants would often roam randomly through the village (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sapadānacārī</i>). However if an invitation such as this were issued, the mendicant may visit that place for a meal. It was considered a special ascetic practice to refuse such invitations. The same invitation was issued by Lohicca to Mahākaccāna at <a href="../sn/sn35.132.html#invitation">SN35.132</a>.</span></span></span> The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, give you a seat and water, and gain confidence in their hearts. That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Māṇavikā</i> is also mentioned at <a href="../mn/mn56.html#manavika">MN56</a> and <a href="../ud/ud2.6.html#content">Ud2.6</a> of a young married woman; and at <a href="../an/an5.192.html#manavika">AN5.192</a> of a baby being born.
