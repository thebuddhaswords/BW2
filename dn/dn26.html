<h3 class="subheading">1. Taking Refuge in Oneself </h3>



<p id="dn26:1.1"><span class="parno">dn26:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Mātulā</i> means “maternal uncle”.</span></span></span> There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>



<p id="dn26:1.5"><span class="parno">dn26:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>



<p id="dn26:1.7"><span class="parno">dn26:1.7</span>“Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:2.26.1">DN16:2.26.1</a>.</span></span></span> And how does a mendicant do this? They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. </p>



<p id="dn26:1.14"><span class="parno">dn26:1.14</span>You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Two parables on mindfulness expand this idea (<a href="../sn/sn47.6.html#content">SN47.6</a>, <a href="../sn/sn46.7.html#content">SN46.7</a>).</span></span></span> If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t catch you or get hold of you. It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Evamidaṁ</i> indicates entailment, as at <a href="../sn/sn56.21.html#content">SN56.21</a>, <a href="../mn/mn73.html#Evamidaṁ">MN73</a>, <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:2.1.3">DN16:2.2.2</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. King Daḷhanemi </h3>



<p id="dn26:2.1"><span class="parno">dn26:2.1</span>Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">We have heard the story of the wheel-turning monarch Mahāsudassana in <a href="../dn/dn17.html#content">DN17</a>. Daḷhanemi appears only here. His name means “Strong-rim”, such being one of the characteristics of the Wheel. His story of renunciation shares much in common with that of Maghadeva (<a href="../mn/mn83.html#content">MN 83</a>).</span></span></span> He had the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder, and the commander as the seventh treasure. He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn26:3.1"><span class="parno">dn26:3.1</span>Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men, ‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Receded back” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">osakkitaṁ</i>): like a woman shrinking away from a man’s unwanted advances (<a href="../dn/dn12.html#dn12:16.4">DN12</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn26:3.3"><span class="parno">dn26:3.3</span>‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. </p>



<p id="dn26:3.4"><span class="parno">dn26:3.4</span>After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’ </p>



<p id="dn26:3.6"><span class="parno">dn26:3.6</span>So the king summoned the crown prince and said, ‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place. I’ve heard that when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live. I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The same point of view is expressed at <a href="../vi/bi-vb-pc21.html#content">Bhikkhuni Pacittiya 21</a>, where sex workers teased nuns, suggesting they enjoy themselves while young and ordain when old. The Buddhist position is that Dhamma can be practiced at any age.</span></span></span> Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean! I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’ </p>



<p id="dn26:3.13"><span class="parno">dn26:3.13</span>And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The signs of the renunciate predate Buddhism.</span></span></span> Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. </p>



<p id="dn26:4.1"><span class="parno">dn26:4.1</span>Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. He went to the royal seer and said,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “royal seer” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">rājisi</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">rājarṣi</i>) is described by Kauṭilya (Arthaśāstra 1.7.1). Such a king should pursue pleasures in moderation, rely on good advice, and work energetically for the welfare and prosperity of his people.</span></span></span> ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ </p>



<p id="dn26:4.6"><span class="parno">dn26:4.6</span>When he said this, the royal seer said to him, ‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Inherited from your father” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pettikaṁ dāyajjaṁ</i>) calls back to the four <i lang="pi" translate="no">satipaṭṭhānas</i> that for a mendicant are “the domain of your fathers” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pettike visaye</i>). In both cases they are to be earned, not conferred by lineage.</span></span></span> Come now, my dear, proceed in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“The noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ariye cakkavattivatte</i>; this is locative singular). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Ariya</i> (“noble”) qualifies “duty” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vatta</i>), as it does in the title below, <i lang="pi" translate="no">cakkavattiariyavatta</i>, rather than “monarch”. Normally <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> is reserved for those who have attained the Buddhist path, but here we might have a rare use of <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> in reference to Indo-Aryan (Vedic) culture. Compare the use of <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariyaka</i> for Indo-Aryan language (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj1.html#ariyaka">Bhikkhu Pārājika 1</a>), and <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariyaṁ āyatanaṁ</i> for the “civilized region” (<a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:1.28.1">DN16:1.28.7</a>, <a href="../an/an6.96.html#content">AN6.96</a>, <a href="../ud/ud8.6.html#ariyan">Ud8.6</a>). However, the commentary says it simply means “flawless” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">niddoso</i>).</span></span></span> If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’ </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Noble Duty of a Wheel-Turning Monarch </h4>



<p id="dn26:5.1"><span class="parno">dn26:5.1</span>‘But sire, what is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch?’ </p>



<p id="dn26:5.2"><span class="parno">dn26:5.2</span>‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Saṁvidahassu</i> is second middle imperative.</span></span></span> Do not let injustice prevail in the realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pavattittha</i> is aorist middle. <i lang="pi" translate="no">(A)dhammakāra</i> (“(in)justice”) doesn’t seem to occur elsewhere in early Pali. It is found in Jatakas 498 and 513, both times in the context of just rule.</span></span></span> Provide money to the penniless in the realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Provide” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anuppadeti</i>) is used elsewhere in the sense of paying back a loan (<a href="../an/an3.20.html#anuppadeti">AN3.20</a>), serving honored guests (<a href="../sn/sn7.2.html#anuppadeti">SN7.2</a>), paying wages (<a href="../dn/dn31.html#anuppadeti">DN31:32.2</a>), or a king supplying provisions for essential workers to do their job (<a href="../dn/dn5.html#dn5:11.4">DN5:11.8</a>). It is thus more about fulfilling a moral obligation of fairness than offering charity.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn26:5.5"><span class="parno">dn26:5.5</span>And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask and learn:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Where the phrase “from time to time go to them” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">te kālena kālaṁ upasaṅkamitvā</i>) occurs elsewhere in the suttas, it is always followed by “ask and question” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paripucchati paripañhati</i>). Here, however, the second verb is “you should learn” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pariggaṇheyyāsi</i>).</span></span></span> “Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?” Having heard them, you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful. </p>



<p id="dn26:5.8"><span class="parno">dn26:5.8</span>This is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.’ </p>



<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Wheel-Treasure Appears </h4>



<p id="dn26:5.10"><span class="parno">dn26:5.10</span>‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the new king to the royal seer. And he proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. </p>



<p id="dn26:5.11"><span class="parno">dn26:5.11</span>While he was proceeding in that duty, on a fifteenth day sabbath, he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail. Seeing this, the king thought, ‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’ </p>

<a id="bhunjatha"></a>

<p id="dn26:6.1"><span class="parno">dn26:6.1</span>Then the anointed king, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying, ‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’ </p>



<p id="dn26:6.3"><span class="parno">dn26:6.3</span>Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ The wheel-turning monarch said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals. </p>



<p id="dn26:7.1"><span class="parno">dn26:7.1</span>Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. … Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. … </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn26:7.9"><span class="parno">dn26:7.9</span>Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ The wheel-turning monarch said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink liquor. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals. </p>



<p id="dn26:7.16"><span class="parno">dn26:7.16</span>And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. On Subsequent Wheel-Turning Monarchs </h3>



<p id="dn26:8.1"><span class="parno">dn26:8.1</span>And for a second time, and a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh time, a wheel-turning monarch was established in exactly the same way. And after many years the seventh wheel-turning monarch went forth, handing the realm over to the crown prince. </p>



<p id="dn26:8.17"><span class="parno">dn26:8.17</span>Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. </p>



<p id="dn26:9.1"><span class="parno">dn26:9.1</span>Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. But he didn’t go to the royal seer and ask about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. He just governed the country according to his own ideas.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Own ideas” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">sa-mata</i>.</span></span></span> So governed, the country’s people did not prosper like before, as they had when former kings proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pabbanti</i> is unusual and probably unique in early Pali. It is related to Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">parvati</i> (“fill”) and is explained by the commentary as <i lang="pi" translate="no">vaḍḍhanti</i> (“grow, prosper”). <br> I assume <i lang="pi" translate="no">janapadā</i> (“countries”) is a misspelling of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jānapadā</i> (“people of the country”), as <i lang="pi" translate="no">janapada</i> is otherwise in singular.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>

<h3 class="subheading">4. On the Period of Decline </h3>



<p id="dn26:10.1"><span class="parno">dn26:10.1</span>So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and councillors, finance ministers, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. And they answered him. After listening to them, he provided just protection and security. But he did not provide money to the penniless in the realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ensuring citizens have enough to live on is not merely a matter of kindness and common decency, but is crucial to ensure stability and national unity.</span></span></span> And so poverty grew widespread. </p>



<p id="dn26:10.5"><span class="parno">dn26:10.5</span>When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The origins of theft are told at <a href="../dn/dn27.html#stealing">DN27:19.1</a>.

<p id="dn26:10.9"><span class="parno">dn26:10.9</span>The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, worthy man, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The king uses the same procedure as the Buddha.

<p id="dn26:10.14"><span class="parno">dn26:10.14</span>So the king provided some money to that person, saying, ‘With this money, worthy man, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Simply providing money is not enough, nor is simply expecting that people can just work for what they want.

<p id="dn26:12.14"><span class="parno">dn26:12.14</span>Then the king thought, ‘If I provide money to anyone who steals from others, it will only increase the stealing.

<p id="dn26:12.19"><span class="parno">dn26:12.19</span>‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded. </p>



<p id="dn26:13.1"><span class="parno">dn26:13.1</span>People heard about this: ‘It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others!’ It occurred to them, ‘We’d better have sharp swords made.

<p id="dn26:14.1"><span class="parno">dn26:14.1</span>And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty became widespread. When poverty was widespread, theft became widespread.

The commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations. <br> “Illicit desire” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhammarāgo</i>) probably refers to any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest, rape, or pedophilia. <br> “Immoral greed” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">visamalobho</i>) implies excess and imbalance. Both are, however, explained in the commentary to <a href="../an/an3.56.html#">AN3.56:2.1</a> as desire for the belongings of others. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Micchādhammo</i> is hard to pin down. Its opposite, <i lang="pi" translate="no">sammā dhammo</i> always means “right teaching”.

Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.

<h3 class="subheading">9. On Long Life and Beauty for Mendicants </h3>



<p id="dn26:28.1"><span class="parno">dn26:28.1</span>Mendicants, you should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. Doing so, you will grow in lifespan, beauty, happiness, wealth, and power. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.3"><span class="parno">dn26:28.3</span>And what is long life for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. Having developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power they may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. This is long life for a mendicant. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.10"><span class="parno">dn26:28.10</span>And what is beauty for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is beauty for a mendicant. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.13"><span class="parno">dn26:28.13</span>And what is happiness for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is happiness for a mendicant. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.19"><span class="parno">dn26:28.19</span>And what is wealth for a mendicant? It’s when a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is wealth for a mendicant. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.25"><span class="parno">dn26:28.25</span>And what is power for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is power for a mendicant. </p>



<p id="dn26:28.28"><span class="parno">dn26:28.28</span>Mendicants, I do not see a single power so hard to defeat as the power of Māra. It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows.” </p>



<p id="dn26:28.30"><span class="parno">dn26:28.30</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>
