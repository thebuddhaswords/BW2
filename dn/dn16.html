<p id="dn16:1.1.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The longest of all early discourses, this dramatic and moving narrative tells the story of the Buddha’s slow journey towards his final passing.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>

<p>Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">After the events of <a href="../dn/dn2.html#content">DN2</a>, Ajātasattu retained and consolidated his power. Magadha ultimately conquered the Vajji Federation and continued to expand until almost all of India was under its sway.</span></span></span> He declared: “I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to the commentary, Ajātasattu’s anger was rooted in a dispute on trade routes. Control of shipping on the Ganges was essential for establishing international trade. There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajji. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjis kept absconding with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but Munger, a strategic port east of Patna, fits the description. The nearby hills have been mined since paleolithic times. It is also likely, as maintained in Jain tradition, that the Vajjis disputed Ajātasattu’s accession after committing regicide. His threatening posture towards the Vajjis is also mentioned in <a href="../sn/sn20.8.html#content">SN20.8</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<hr>

<p id="dn16:1.2.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.2.1</span>And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Magadha,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vassakāra appears in the suttas as a devoted follower of the Buddha.</span></span></span></p>

<p>“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. </p>

<p>And then say: ‘Sir, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wants to invade the Vajjis. He says, “I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!”’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Vajji Federation harks back to an early settlement founded by the legendary Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains and the trading possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers.</span></span></span> Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me. For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even if it is bad news. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">1. The Brahmin Vassakāra </h3>



<p id="dn16:1.3.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.3.1</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">yojapetvā</i> (“had them harnessed”), which is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and in this passage in the PTS edition.</span></span></span> He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.3.3"><span class="parno">dn16:1.3.3</span>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, </p>

<p>“Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. </p>

<p>Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis. He has declared: ‘I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!’” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">2. Principles That Prevent Decline </h3>



<p id="dn16:1.4.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.1</span>Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ānanda cares for the Buddha in his old age. Shortly after these events, Ānanda was entrusted with reciting the suttas at the First Council. This discourse would have been composed by him in the years following his Master’s death. More than a simple interlocutor, Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character with an empathetic point of view. He imbues the discourse with his emotional struggles as he deals with the Buddha’s passing and helps ensure the future survival of the Dhamma, while still developing his own meditation practice.</span></span></span> Then the Buddha said to him, </p>

<hr>
<p>“Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?”</p>




<p id="dn16:1.4.4"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.4</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.5"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.5</span>“As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.6"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.6</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Harmony is especially important as the Vajji Federation was comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavis of Vesālī, the Ñātikas just south of Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma (Elephant Village), and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. Some sources say the Vajjis proper were another tribe within the alliance. The Videhans of Mithilā are also sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a closely allied independent republic.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.7"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.7</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.8"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.8</span>“As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.9"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.9</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">porāṇe vajjidhamme</i>) would have been established with the founding of the Vajji Federation some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā</i> at <a href="../an/an5.191.html#content">AN5.191</a> and <a href="../snp/snp2.7.html#content">Snp2.7</a>), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline. Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjis for their indulgence (<a href="../an/an5.143.html#content">AN5.143</a>), suggesting that the decline may have already set in.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.10"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.10</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.11"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.11</span>“As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.12"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.12</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.13"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.13</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.14"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.14</span>“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.15"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.15</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual violence. <br> For various legal regulations regarding women and sex, see Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 12.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.16"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.16</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.17"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.17</span>“As long as the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.18"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.18</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. <br> “Spirit-offerings” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">bali</i>. <br> The commentary explains “inner or outer” as inside or outside the town.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.19"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.19</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.20"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.20</span>“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.4.21"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.21</span>Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.22"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.22</span>“I have heard that, sir.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.4.23"><span class="parno">dn16:1.4.23</span>“As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.5.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.5.1</span>Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra, “Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This event is recorded at <a href="../an/an7.21.html#content">AN7.21</a>, where the Buddha addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate suttas. <br> The Sārandada shrine was short walk from Vesālī (<a href="../an/an5.143.html#content">AN5.143</a>).</span></span></span> There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent decline.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not adopt new decrees. It seems that a “decree” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paññatta</i>) is more like constitutional law, whereas a “principle” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i>) is more like a behavioral guideline.</span></span></span> As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.5.5"><span class="parno">dn16:1.5.5</span>When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him, “Worthy Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline. How much more so all seven! King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by bribery or by sowing dissension.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Upalāpana</i> is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at <a href="../sn/sn3.25.html#upalapana">SN3.25</a>, where an enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. <br> The commentary says that Vassakāra himself was assigned with the task of weakening the Vajjis in this way.</span></span></span> Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>



<p id="dn16:1.5.10"><span class="parno">dn16:1.5.10</span>“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.” Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">3. Principles That Prevent Decline Among the Mendicants </h3>



<p id="dn16:1.6.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.6.1</span>Soon after he had left, the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rājagaha together in the assembly hall.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There were several monasteries and hermitages around Rājagaha (<a href="../vi/kd2.html#monasteries">Khandhaka 2</a>).</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.6.3"><span class="parno">dn16:1.6.3</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked. Then he went back, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.” </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.6.5"><span class="parno">dn16:1.6.5</span>Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent decline.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../an/an7.23.html#content">AN7.23</a>.</span></span></span> Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.6.9"><span class="parno">dn16:1.6.9</span>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:1.6.11"><span class="parno">dn16:1.6.11</span>“As long as the mendicants meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This especially refers to the fortnightly <i lang="pi" translate="no">uposatha</i>.

<p>As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">From this point, later texts always refer to Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Putta</i> is a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāṭaliputta</i> means “a person from Pāṭalī (village)” or as we might say, “Pāṭalian”. As the city became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must have become known as the “city of the Pāṭaliputtas” and hence simply Pāṭaliputta. Compare the uses of <i lang="pi" translate="no">ñātika</i> below. <br> The commentary explains that <i lang="pi" translate="no">puṭabhedanaṁ</i> refers to the “opening of packages”, signifying that it was a center of trade.

It is situated on a low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have been an obvious danger. As for dissension (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mithubheda</i>), Vassakāra had indicated that this was a means of bringing down the Vajjis, so it would seem that kamma was lying in wait for them.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn16:1.30.1"><span class="parno">dn16:1.30.1</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared.

<p>She had the finest carriages harnessed. Then she mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī for her own park.

Some of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue.

<p id="dn16:2.19.3"><span class="parno">dn16:2.19.3</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Ambapālī together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out.

<p id="dn16:2.19.5"><span class="parno">dn16:2.19.5</span>When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Ambapālī took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, I present this park to the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This demonstrates that a woman of Ambapālī’s profession could own land and control significant resources.</span></span></span></p>

<h3 class="subheading">12. Commencing the Rains at Beluva </h3>



<p id="dn16:2.21.1"><span class="parno">dn16:2.21.1</span>When the Buddha had stayed in Ambapālī’s mango grove as long as he pleased, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the little village of Beluva.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pali texts waver between <i lang="pi" translate="no">beluva</i> (“wood-apple”) and <i lang="pi" translate="no">veḷuva</i> (from <i lang="pi" translate="no">veḷuvant</i>, “full of bamboo”).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:2.21.3"><span class="parno">dn16:2.21.3</span>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the little village of Beluva, and stayed there. </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn16:2.22.1"><span class="parno">dn16:2.22.1</span>There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:</p>

<p> “Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha was travelling with a large retinue, which could become burdensome on a small village if they were to stay the three months of the rains residence.

<p id="dn16:2.22.4"><span class="parno">dn16:2.22.4</span>“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. </p>



<p id="dn16:2.23.1"><span class="parno">dn16:2.23.1</span>After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred to the Buddha, “It would not be appropriate for me to be fully extinguished before informing my supporters and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here <i lang="pi" translate="no">upaṭṭhāka</i> refers to the lay devotees. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Apaloketi</i> (“take leave”) also has a literal sense of “glance back”; both senses are found in this sutta.</span></span></span> Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Life force” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">jīvitasaṅkhāra</i> whereas below we find <i lang="pi" translate="no">āyusaṅkhāra</i> (<a href="../dn/dn16.html#">DN16</a>).

Elsewhere, however, <i lang="pi" translate="no">āyusaṅkhāra</i> clearly means “life force” (<a href="../sn/sn20.6.html#content">SN20.6</a>, <a href="../mn/mn43.html#lifeforce">MN43</a>).</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:2.24.1"><span class="parno">dn16:2.24.1</span>So that is what he did. Then the Buddha’s illness died down. </p>



<p id="dn16:2.24.3"><span class="parno">dn16:2.24.3</span>Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he came out from his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. </p>

<p>Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, </p>

<p>“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable and well. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings weren’t clear to me. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that the Buddha won’t be fully extinguished without bringing something up regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Previously the Buddha had spoken of “taking leave” of the Saṅgha, but here something more specific is meant. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Udāharati</i> is typically used when a previously-mentioned matter (often unpleasant) is “brought up”, as at the monastic procedures for confession or invitation to admonish. Ānanda is implying that there is some unfinished disciplinary business that needs attention. Despite the Buddha’s response, he did in fact go on to make a number of statements and rulings.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:2.25.1"><span class="parno">dn16:2.25.1</span>“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me, Ānanda?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For forty-five years he had been teaching and supporting the community.</span></span></span> I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A principle not followed by some contemporary Buddhist schools that harbor “secret teachings”.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a tutor when it comes to the teachings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Closed fist of a tutor” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">ācariyamuṭṭhi</i>. Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.2.4: “I have taught you all that I know.”</span></span></span> If there’s anyone who thinks: ‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha. But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, so why should he bring something up regarding the Saṅgha?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Pariharissāmi</i> needs careful parsing with regard to tenses. The general meaning is to “carry about” or “maintain, nurture”. The Buddha elsewhere said that he “leads” the Saṅgha (<a href="../dn/dn26.html#leads">DN26</a>: <i lang="pi" translate="no">pariharāmi</i>). When the Buddha was about to go on retreat, Moggallāna said that he and Sāriputta “shall lead” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pariharissāmi</i>), to which the Buddha said they “should lead” (<a href="../mn/mn67.html#lead">MN67</a>: <i lang="pi" translate="no">parihareyyaṁ</i>). Devadatta, on the other hand, ensured his downfall when he determined that he “shall lead” the Saṅgha, having taken over from the Buddha (<a href="../an/an5.100.html#content">AN5.100</a>). Thus the future tense indicates the determination to lead. But at this point, the Buddha’s mind is already set on letting go. He is not saying that no-one should lead the Saṅgha, but that it is up to whoever leads it to address the issues.</span></span></span></p>

Thus it probably refers to a kind of strong twisted material used to tie or bind, i.e. rope.</span></span></span> in the same way, the Realized One’s body is kept going as if by a rope.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare Rig Veda 8.48.5: “As leather binds a chariot, soma knits my joints together.” Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.35 compares the labored breathing of one near death with the creaking of a heavily-laden cart. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.2.7.8 says a handsome cart is well-finished with ropes. Indian carts were bound with ropes down to modern times.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The suttas say little about this signless (<i lang="pi" translate="no">animitta</i>) meditation. Its defining characteristic is that consciousness does not “follow after signs” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nimittānusāri viññāṇaṁ</i>, eg. <a href="../an/an6.13.html#content">AN6.13</a>). This is explained in <a href="../mn/mn138.html#features">MN138</a> as not being distracted or affected by the features of sense impressions, as the “signs” are created by greed, hate, and delusion (<a href="../mn/mn43.html#signless">MN43</a>). The mental unification (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ekattaṁ</i>)  based on this practice is listed after the form (and formless) <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i>, so it is very advanced. It is nonetheless a conditioned state (<a href="../mn/mn121.html#">MN121</a>), so it is possible that a mendicant might fall from it and disrobe (<a href="../an/an6.60.html#">AN6.60</a>). However it may also be used to describe the meditation of an arahant (<a href="../sn/sn41.7.html#">SN41.7</a>). It is clear from <a href="../mn/mn121.html#conditioned">MN121</a> that the six senses are still functioning, unlike in deep serenity meditations.

<p id="dn16:3.5.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.5.1</span>For a second time … </p>

<p>And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: “Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Shrines are all lovely. </p>

<p>Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.” </p>



<p id="dn16:3.5.6"><span class="parno">dn16:3.5.6</span>But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha: “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the proper lifespan! May the Holy One please remain for the proper lifespan! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>



<p id="dn16:3.6.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.6.1</span>Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” </p>



<p id="dn16:3.6.4"><span class="parno">dn16:3.6.4</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">14. The Appeal of Māra </h3>



<p id="dn16:3.7.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.7.1</span>And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but this sequence is his only direct appearance in the Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for with the Buddha’s passing Māra’s job will be much easier.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:3.7.2"><span class="parno">dn16:3.7.2</span>“Sir, may the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Parinibbāna</i> means “extinguishment”, as of a flame. Here it appears as both noun (“extinguishment”) and verb (“become extinguished”). It is not a particularly difficult term to translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with “attachment”, so renderings such as “unbinding” are untenable. It should be translated rather than just keeping “Nibbāna”, not least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in such constructions as “enter Nibbāna”, which reifies it in a way that the Pali does not.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>

<p>Sir, you once made this statement: </p>

<p>‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Māra is citing the Buddha’s words for his own purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha’s awakening.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:3.8.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.1</span>Today you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! </p>

<p>May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:3.8.3"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.3</span>Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha’s intention from the beginning to establish an order of nuns (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhunī</i>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:3.8.5"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.5</span>Today you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha. </p>



<p id="dn16:3.8.7"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.7</span>Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ </p>

<p id="dn16:3.8.11"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.11</span>Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ </p>

<p id="dn16:3.8.15"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.15</span>Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not be fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ </p>



<p id="dn16:3.8.17"><span class="parno">dn16:3.8.17</span>Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. May the Blessed One now be fully extinguished! May the Holy One now be fully extinguished! Now is the time for the full extinguishment of the Buddha.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn16:3.9.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.9.1</span>When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, </p>


<p>“Relax, Wicked One. The full extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach (<a href="../sn/sn6.1.html#content">SN6.1</a>, etc.). Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to passing away because of Māra’s request, although his intent was clear earlier. Māra’s reasoning, moreover, is based on the Buddha’s own words.</span></span></span> Three months from now the Realized One will be fully extinguished.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the rains in Beluva village, from where he would sometimes go to nearby Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation. He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the rains. If this reasoning is correct—and the text is not explicit—then he made this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. This conflicts with the tradition of ascribing his final extinguishment to the full moon of Vesak, in May.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">15. Surrendering the Life Force </h3>



<p id="dn16:3.10.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.10.1</span>So at the Cāpāla Shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named after the <i lang="pi" translate="no">yakkha</i> who formerly lived there. Now, <i lang="pi" translate="no">cāpalla</i> means “fickleness, propensity to tremble” and is from the same root as earth-“quake” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhumicāla</i>; <i lang="pi" translate="no">capala</i> = <i lang="pi" translate="no">pacala</i> via metathesis). It is no great leap to <i lang="pi" translate="no">cāpāla</i>. If this is correct, it suggests that the shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a fitting setting for the events to follow.</span></span></span> When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if the causes are not scientific.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>


<hr>


<div class="verse">
		<p id="dn16:3.10.4"><span class="parno">dn16:3.10.4</span>
		“Comparing the incomparable with the creation of prolonged life,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in <em>Connected Discourses of the Buddha</em>, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Sambhava</i> means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected.</span></span></span><br/>
		the sage surrendered the life force.*<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Bhavasaṅkhāra</i> (“life force”) here is equivalent to <i lang="pi" translate="no">āyusaṅkhāra</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">jīvitasaṅkhāra</i>.</span></span></span><br/>

<h3 class="subheading">16. The Causes of Earthquakes </h3>



<p id="dn16:3.11.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.11.1</span>Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “How incredible, how amazing! That was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>



<p id="dn16:3.12.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.12.1</span>Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “How incredible, sir, how amazing!

What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:3.13.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.13.1</span>“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake. What eight? </p>



<p id="dn16:3.13.3"><span class="parno">dn16:3.13.3</span>This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.”</span></span></span> This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>

<a id="tremble"></a>

<p id="dn16:3.14.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.14.1</span>Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. <a href="../mn/mn56.html#mighty">MN56</a>). The meditation described here might be compared with the “dimensions of mastery” below.</span></span></span> This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>



<p id="dn16:3.15.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.15.1</span>Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of joyful gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware.

<p id="dn16:3.16.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.16.1</span>Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>



<p id="dn16:3.17.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.17.1</span>Furthermore, when the Realized One awakens to the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There are many accounts of the Buddha’s awakening in the suttas, but none, so far as I know, that mention an earthquake.</span></span></span> This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>

<p id="dn16:3.20.1"><span class="parno">dn16:3.20.1</span>Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This refers to the Buddha’s death. The Pali here uses both <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">parinibbāna</i>.

<p>The assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods of the four great kings. An assembly of the gods of the thirty-three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of divinities.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These “assemblies” were formal deliberative meetings, not just gatherings.

At <a href="../dn/dn6.html#content">DN6</a>, brahmins assemble in Vesālī; while at <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.13.1">DN3</a>, Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were aristocrats.

At Kena Upaniṣad 3, Brahma appears to the gods and tests them, but they do not know him.</span></span></span></p>

I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the “seven maidens” who gave the island its name. Stories of “seven maidens” are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the seven sisters was lost.

<p id="dn16:4.8.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.8.1</span>“Take a mendicant who says: ‘Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase used in the suttas when reporting a teaching heard directly from the Buddha.</span></span></span> this is the teaching, this is the training, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Dhamma</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinaya</i>, and <i lang="pi" translate="no">satthusāsana</i> are used in the suttas in the general sense of the entirety of the Buddha’s teachings. In his advice to Mahāpajāpatī (<a href="../an/an8.53.html#content">AN8.53</a>) and Upāli (<a href="../an/an7.83.html#content">AN7.83</a>), they are said to be whatever conforms with letting go.

They are more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a legitimate legal procedure (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc63.html#content">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 63</a>). Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">sutta</i> are different words, we should not take <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinaya</i> here as equivalent to <i lang="pi" translate="no">sutta</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinaya</i> below.

The late canonical Netti explains <i lang="pi" translate="no">sutta</i> as “the four noble truths” and <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinaya</i> as “the removal of greed, hate, and delusion”. The commentaries discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti for <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinaya</i>, but say <i lang="pi" translate="no">sutta</i> means the entire Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings should “fit in” with the four noble truths (like other footprints fit in to an elephant’s footprint, <a href="../mn/mn28.html#content">MN 28</a>), and they should “be exhibited” in that the results of practice should be apparent (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sandiṭṭhika</i>). <br> “Memorize” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">uggahetvā</i>), because in an oral tradition a text is not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken seriously. <br> “Fit into” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">osāreti</i> or <i lang="pi" translate="no">otāreti</i> per <a href="../an/an4.180.html#content">AN4.180</a>; the two words have a similar meaning, “to flow down into”.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn16:4.13.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.13.1</span>When the Buddha had stayed in Bhoga City as long as he pleased, he addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Pāvā.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pāvā, a town of the Mallas, has more significance for this narrative than appears at first sight. It was, according to Buddhist texts, the place where Mahāvīra had recently died, plunging the Jains into chaos. (The Jains, however, say this was another Pāvā, east of Nāḷandā.) Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks: thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a particularly strong discourse (<a href="../sn/sn15.13.html#content">SN15.13</a>); Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha’s passing at Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with monks of “Avanti and the south” arguing for strict Vinaya in the Second Council (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#1.7.11">Kd 1:1.7.11</a>).</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:4.13.3"><span class="parno">dn16:4.13.3</span>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.

<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.14.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.14.1</span>Cunda heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in his mango grove. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is, according to the commentary, preserved as the other discourse taught to Cunda, which deals with proper asceticism (<a href="../snp/snp1.5.html#content">Snp1.5</a>).</span></span></span> Then Cunda said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” </p>

<p>The Buddha consented with silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.17.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.17.1</span>And when the night had passed Cunda had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The exact meaning of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sūkaramaddava</i> is unclear. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Sūkara</i> is “pig”, but some Chinese translations suggest the sense “mushroom”; and it is true that there are several names of plants or plant dishes that begin with <i lang="pi" translate="no">sūkara</i> or other animals. At <a href="../dhp/dhp360-382.html#withered">Dhp377</a>, flowers are described as <i lang="pi" translate="no">maddava</i>, meaning “overripe, withering on the vine”. It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become tender and “high” for extra flavor when cooked. But this can lead to a proliferation of dangerous bacteria unless properly cooked, and such seems to have been the case here. In any case, this disputed term is marginal in a consideration of meat-eating in early Buddhism, which is discussed more fully elsewhere.</span></span></span> “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.18.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.18.1</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Cunda together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed Cunda, “Cunda, please serve me with the pork on the turn that you’ve prepared.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">If the Buddha knew the meal was dangerous, why ask to be served it? This is even more striking in light of the fact that it is a Vinaya offence to request fine food, including meat, and nowhere else is such a request recorded (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc39.html#content">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 39</a>). Such narrative ambiguities serve to escalate a sense of wonder.</span></span></span> And serve the mendicant Saṅgha with the other foods.” </p>

<p id="dn16:4.30.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.30.1</span>“This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a threshing-hut. At that time the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.

<p id="dn16:4.31.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.31.1</span>Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking mindfully in the open near the door of the hut. Then having left that crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I said to them, </p>

<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.32.2"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.2</span>‘Just now, sir, the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. Then this crowd gathered here. But sir, where were you?’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.5"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.5</span>‘I was right here, friend.’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.6"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.6</span>‘But sir, did you see?’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.7"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.7</span>‘No, friend, I didn’t see anything.’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.8"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.8</span>‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.9"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.9</span>‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’ </p>

<p id="dn16:4.32.12"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.12</span>‘But sir, were you conscious?’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.13"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.13</span>‘Yes, friend.’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.14"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.14</span>‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking?’ </p>



<p id="dn16:4.32.15"><span class="parno">dn16:4.32.15</span>‘Yes, friend.’ </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.33.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.33.1</span>Then that person thought: ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.’ And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.34.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.34.1</span>When he said this, Pukkusa said to him, “Any confidence I had in Āḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream. </p>

<p>Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.35.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.35.1</span>Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man, “Please, my man, fetch a pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Siṅgīvaṇṇa</i>, or else <i lang="pi" translate="no">siṅgīsuvaṇṇa</i> (<a href="../an/an3.70.html#gold">AN3.70</a>), is gold from a mountain peak (<i lang="pi" translate="no">siṅgī</i>). Kauṭilya mentions a form of gold that is <i lang="pi" translate="no">śṛṅgaśūktija</i>, “occurring on mount Śūkti” (Arthaśāstra 2.13.3). The commentary to that passage says it had the color of red arsenic, so it would have been a rose gold color.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:4.35.3"><span class="parno">dn16:4.35.3</span>“Yes, sir,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then Pukkusa brought the garments to the Buddha, “Sir, please accept this pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold from me out of sympathy.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.35.6"><span class="parno">dn16:4.35.6</span>“Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.35.7"><span class="parno">dn16:4.35.7</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Pukkusa, and did so. </p>



<p id="dn16:4.36.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.36.1</span>Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.37.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.37.1</span>Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of garments the color of mountain gold by the Buddha’s body. But when placed by the Buddha’s body they seemed to lose their shine. </p>

<p>Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how pure and bright is the color of the Realized One’s skin. When this pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold is placed by the Buddha’s body they seem to lose their sheen.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.37.6"><span class="parno">dn16:4.37.6</span>“That’s so true, Ānanda, that’s so true! There are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright.</p>

<p> What two? </p>

<p id="dn16:4.39.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.39.1</span>Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakudhā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The monk Cundaka makes an abrupt appearance here; this is the only mention of this name. The commentary to this passage calls him <i lang="pi" translate="no">cunda</i>, while the gloss to the parallel passage at <a href="../ud/ud8.5.html#content">Ud8.5</a> has <i lang="pi" translate="no">cundaka</i> throughout. The diminutive ending <i lang="pi" translate="no">-ka</i> is perhaps meant to differentiate him from the smith Cunda. There are various Cundas whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the great disciples (<a href="../mn/mn118.html#content">MN118</a>, <a href="../an/an6.17.html#content">AN6.17</a>, <a href="../mn/mn8.html#content">MN8</a>), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs (<a href="../an/an6.46.html#content">AN6.46</a>, <a href="../an/an10.24.html#content">AN10.24</a>). He once stayed with Channa and Sāriputta (<a href="../mn/mn144.html#content">MN144</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.87.html#content">SN35.87</a>); the commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta’s younger brother. They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta (<a href="../sn/sn47.13.html#content">SN47.13</a>) and Mahāvīra (<a href="../dn/dn29.html#content">DN29</a>, <a href="../mn/mn104.html#content">MN104</a>), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person, but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda in the Therāpadāna. Thus there may have been one person known by different names, or several people whose stories have become conflated.</span></span></span> “Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.” </p>



<p id="dn16:4.40.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.40.1</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha. </p>

<p id="dn16:4.42.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.42.1</span>Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda: </p>

<p>You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this: ‘You’re fortunate, respected Cunda, you’re so very fortunate, in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.

There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Again, the narrative circle.</span></span></span></p>

<p>What two? </p>

<hr><a id="longlife"></a>

<p>The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One awakens to the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue.

<hr>


<p id="dn16:4.43.1"><span class="parno">dn16:4.43.1</span>Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>

<p class="endsection" id="dn16:4.43.6">The fourth recitation section. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">26. The Pair of Sal Trees </h3>



<p id="dn16:5.1.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.1.1</span>Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the far shore of the Golden River, and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Known today as Kushinagar, it is a popular site for pilgrims, with many ancient stupas, Buddha images, and a peaceful park for meditation.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.1.3"><span class="parno">dn16:5.1.3</span>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. And that’s where they went. Then the Buddha addressed Ānanda, “Please, Ānanda, set up a cot for me between the twin sal trees, with my head to the north. I am tired and will lie down.” </p>



<p id="dn16:5.1.6"><span class="parno">dn16:5.1.6</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally when the Buddha lies down, his mind is focused on getting up. But now he knows that he will not rise again.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.2.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.2.1</span>Now at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers out of season.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sal trees blossom in April/May. This detail agrees with the Buddha’s final extinguishment in December/January, rather than in May (Vesak) as is currently celebrated.</span></span></span> They sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And the flowers of the heavenly Flame Tree fell from the sky, and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky, and it too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly music played in midair in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly choirs sang in midair in honor of the Realized One. </p>



<p id="dn16:5.3.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.3.1</span>Then the Buddha pointed out to Ānanda what was happening, adding: “That’s not the full extent of how the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. Any monk or nun or male or female lay follower who practices in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teachings—they honor, respect, revere, venerate, and esteem the Realized One with the highest honor.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in the Māra section above.</span></span></span> So Ānanda, you should train like this: ‘We shall practice in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teaching.’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the Buddha’s teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that such things were of limited worth compared with practice.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">27. The Monk Upavāna </h3>



<p id="dn16:5.4.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.4.1</span>Now at that time Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of the Buddha fanning him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an attendant with Ānanda; at <a href="../dn/dn29.html#upavana">DN29</a> he is also fanning the Buddha.

<p id="dn16:5.4.4"><span class="parno">dn16:5.4.4</span>Ānanda thought, “This Venerable Upavāna has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In <a href="../sn/sn7.13.html#content">SN7.13</a> Upavāna fetched hot water and molasses for the Buddha, an event he remembered in his own verses at <a href="../tha/tha2.html#upavana">Therigatha 2</a>.</span></span></span> Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying: ‘Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.’ What is the cause, what is the reason for this?” </p>



<p id="dn16:5.5.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.5.1</span>Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “This Venerable Upavāna has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence.

<p id="dn16:5.5.7"><span class="parno">dn16:5.5.7</span>“Most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One.

<p id="dn16:5.6.2"><span class="parno">dn16:5.6.2</span>“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in space and on the earth—who are aware of the earth.

Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg.

<p id="dn16:5.6.6"><span class="parno">dn16:5.6.6</span>But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking: ‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These two reactions—grief and equanimity—are depicted often in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition, feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher, developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive, resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine. A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system analyzing the impermanence of “conditions”, leading to the Abhidhamma.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn16:5.8.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.8.1</span>“Ānanda, a faithful gentleman should go to see these four inspiring places.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These four sites are the primary destinations of modern Buddhist pilgrims in India. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Saṁvejanīya</i> is “stirring, provoking inspiration or urgency” such as when seeing an astonishing, disturbing, or amazing sight.</span></span></span> What four? </p>

<p>Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One was born!’—that is an inspiring place.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Lumbinī in modern Nepal, which today is a well-maintained and quiet place for devotion and meditation. The site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after this time.

This is the oldest direct quote from the early canon preserved in the archaeological record.</span></span></span></p>

<p> Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’—that is an inspiring place.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Bodhgaya in modern Bihar, which is called Uruvelā in the Pali texts. It is a bustling center for pilgrims from all over the Buddhist world, at the center of which is the great stupa next to the Bodhi tree.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Thinking: ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’—that is an inspiring place.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Isipatana is modern Sarnath, in the northern part of Varanasi on the Ganges.

<p>Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of extinguishment with no residue!’—that is an inspiring place.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto</i>, “fully quenched in the element of extinguishment” shows how the Pali uses two roots simultaneously for Nibbana. The better-known term, <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nirvāṇa</i>), is from the root <i lang="pi" translate="no">vā</i> (“to blow”), with the basic sense of going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbuta</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nirvṛta</i>), from the root <i lang="pi" translate="no">var</i> (“to check or restrain”), has the basic sense of freedom from obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbuta</i> as the past participle form of <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i>, and for the most part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana. “Quenched” means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using <i lang="pi" translate="no">nirvṛta</i>, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great divinity. By using “extinguishment” for <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i> and “quenched” for <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbuta</i> I hope to express this subtle distinction, or at least to alert the reader that it exists.</span></span></span></p>

<p>These are the four inspiring places that a faithful gentleman should go to see. </p>



<p id="dn16:5.8.8"><span class="parno">dn16:5.8.8</span>Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, and think: ‘Here the Realized One was born!’ and ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’ and ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’ and ‘Here the Realized One was fully quenched in the element of extinguishment with no residue!’ Anyone who passes away while on pilgrimage to these shrines will, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>



<h3 class="subheading">29. Ānanda’s Questions </h3>



<p id="dn16:5.9.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.1</span>“Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to females?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage is absent from the Sanskrit parallel and it is probably a late interpolation. Ānanda was handsome, and many stories of his encounters with women are preserved, for example at <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc41.html#">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 41</a>.</span></span></span>
</p>



<p id="dn16:5.9.2"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.2</span>“Without looking, Ānanda.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As it stands, this appears to contradict <a href="../mn/mn152.html#seeing">MN152</a>, where the Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing. The commentary, however, explains it as not looking at a woman who is standing in the doorway of a monk’s hut, so as not to give rise to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an unusually intimate encounter.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.9.3"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.3</span>“But when looking, how to proceed?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The verb changes from <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭipajjāma</i> (first person plural) to <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭipajjitabbaṁ</i> (future passive participle), a shift that mirrors the following passage regarding the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out the funeral, whereas here that does not apply. This suggests that this passage has been derived from that later passage.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.9.4"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.4</span>“Without chatting, Ānanda.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary refers to <a href="../an/an5.55.html#content">AN5.55</a>, which speaks of chatting alone in private with a woman, a circumstance also dealt with in <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc45.html#content">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 45</a>.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.9.5"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.5</span>“But when chatting, how to proceed?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ānanda does not hesitate to let the Buddha know he has no intention of following his advice.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:5.9.6"><span class="parno">dn16:5.9.6</span>“Be mindful, Ānanda.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary says, quoting <a href="../sn/sn35.127.html#content">SN35.127</a>, that when a woman has sincere motivations, one should speak while thinking of them as a mother, a sister, or a daughter.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="dn16:5.13.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.13.1</span>Then Venerable Ānanda entered a building, and stood there leaning against the door-jamb and crying,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Like Queen Subhaddā, wife of Mahāsudassana, at <a href="../dn/dn17.html#leaning">DN17</a>. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Kapisīsa</i> is door-jamb, not lintel. <br> For <i lang="pi" translate="no">vihāra</i> (“building”) the commentary has “pavillion” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">maṇḍalamāla</i>), which may have been a temporary construction for the occasion (compare <a href="../mn/mn92.html#pavillion">MN92</a>).</span></span></span> “Oh!

<p id="dn16:5.13.3"><span class="parno">dn16:5.13.3</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, where is Ānanda?” </p>

<p id="dn16:5.13.7"><span class="parno">dn16:5.13.7</span>So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, “Please, monk, in my name tell Ānanda that the teacher summons him.” </p>

<p id="dn16:5.13.10"><span class="parno">dn16:5.13.10</span>“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ānanda and said to him, </p>

<p id="dn16:5.14.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.14.1</span>“Yes, reverend,” Ānanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>

How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body? </p>

<p>For a long time, Ānanda, you’ve treated the Realized One with deeds of body, speech, and mind that are loving, beneficial, pleasant, undivided, and limitless.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase “undivided and limitless” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">advayena appamāṇena</i>) normally describes <i lang="pi" translate="no">kasiṇa</i> meditation (<a href="../an/an10.25.html#content">AN10.25</a>); here it is also found in the Sanskrit: <i lang="pi" translate="no">ānanda maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena</i>.</span></span></span> You have done good deeds, Ānanda.

<p id="dn16:5.18.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.18.1</span>Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This story is also found in <a href="../dn/dn17.html#content">DN17</a>. It seems that the Pali tradition extracted the story and greatly expanded it in an independent long discourse, whereas the Sanskrit tradition kept it at a more moderate length within the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra itself.</span></span></span></p>

<p>His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Kusāvatī features in the Kusajātaka (Jataka 531), where the ugly but wise prince Kusa, son of the legendary Okkāka, wins the hand of the radiant Pabhāvatī. The Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī, although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that <i lang="pi" translate="no">kusa</i> grass, a prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage.</span></span></span> It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A “league” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yojana</i>) is usually estimated at between seven and twelve kilometers. By way of comparison, even at its greatest extent under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly legendary.</span></span></span> The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to <a href="../dn/dn32.html#content">DN32</a>, Āḷakamandā was one of the many cities of Kuvera in Uttarakuru.</span></span></span> Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely: the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry: ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth. </p>



<p id="dn16:5.19.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.19.1</span>Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: ‘This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Vāseṭṭha is a Vedic priestly clan. The Mallas adopted the name of their priest’s lineage, which was the normal custom for initiated <i lang="pi" translate="no">khattiyas</i>. Other examples in the Pali are Saccaka who is called Aggivessana (<a href="../mn/mn35.html#aggivessana">MN35</a>), and the Buddha and his family who are called Gotama.</span></span></span> Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’” </p>



<p id="dn16:5.19.6"><span class="parno">dn16:5.19.6</span>“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Attadutiyo</i> “with self as second” is also at <a href="../mn/mn146.html#attadutiyo">MN146</a> where Nandaka visits the nuns. Sanskrit has <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikṣuṇā paścācchramaṇena</i> (“with a mendicant as accompanying ascetic”). It was apparently evening (the “wrong time”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vikāla</i>), when it is inappropriate for a monk to be wandering the town alone.</span></span></span></p>



<h3 class="subheading">33. The Mallas Pay Homage </h3><a id="vasettha"></a>

<p id="dn16:5.20.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.20.1</span>Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the town hall on some business.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Evidently the Mallas, like the Vajjis, met frequently.</span></span></span> Ānanda went up to them, and announced: “This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished. Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’” </p>



<p id="dn16:5.21.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.21.1</span>When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!” </p>



<p id="dn16:5.21.3"><span class="parno">dn16:5.21.3</span>Then the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives, distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached Ānanda. </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:5.22.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.22.1</span>Then Ānanda thought, “If I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one by one, they won’t be finished before first light. I’d better separate them family by family and then have them pay homage, saying: ‘Sir, the Malla named so-and-so with children, wives, retinue, and ministers bows with his head at your feet.’” And so that’s what he did. </p>

<p>So by this means Ānanda got the Mallas to finish paying homage to the Buddha in the first watch of the night. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">34. On Subhadda the Wanderer </h3>



<p id="dn16:5.23.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.23.1</span>Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near Kusinārā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the second Subhadda we have met in this discourse, the first being a deceased devotee of Ñātika.

<p>He thought: “I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: ‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama.

<p id="dn16:5.24.1"><span class="parno">dn16:5.24.1</span>Then Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana, approached Ānanda, and said to him, “Master Ānanda, I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: ‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama.

<p id="dn16:6.13.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.13.3</span>Then—taking those fragrances and garlands, all the musical instruments, and five hundred pairs of garments—they went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached the Buddha’s corpse. They spent the day honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and making awnings and setting up pavilions.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An uplifting response to tragedy, full of beauty and celebration.</span></span></span></p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:6.13.4"><span class="parno">dn16:6.13.4</span>Then they thought, “It’s too late to cremate the Buddha’s corpse today. Let’s do it tomorrow.” </p>

<p>But they spent the next day the same way, and so too the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It seem unlikely that everyone simply forgot. It was probably the custom to wait seven days before the cremation.</span></span></span></p>



<hr>

<p id="dn16:6.14.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.14.1</span>Then on the seventh day they thought, “Honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, let us carry it to the south of the town, and cremate it there outside the town.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:6.14.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.14.3</span>Now at that time eight of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Unworn” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">ahata</i>, as at <a href="../dn/dn14.html#dn14:1.33.1">DN14</a>.</span></span></span> “We shall lift the Buddha’s corpse.” But they were unable to do so. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.14.5"><span class="parno">dn16:6.14.5</span>The Mallas said to Anuruddha, “What is the cause, Honorable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these eight Mallian chiefs are unable to lift the Buddha’s corpse?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.14.8"><span class="parno">dn16:6.14.8</span>“Vāseṭṭhas, you have one plan, but the deities have a different one.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.15.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.15.1</span>“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.15.2"><span class="parno">dn16:6.15.2</span>“You plan to carry the Buddha’s corpse to the south of the town while venerating it with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and cremate it there outside the town. </p>

<p>The deities plan to carry the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they plan to enter the town by the northern gate, carry it through the center of the town, leave by the eastern gate, and cremate it there at the Mallian shrine named Coronation.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Coronation” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">makuṭabandhana</i>, “the binding of the crown”. The commentary says there was, fittingly, an auspicious decorative royal hall there; perhaps too the name was felt to pun with <i lang="pi" translate="no">muktabandhana</i>, “freedom from ties”.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:6.15.6"><span class="parno">dn16:6.15.6</span>“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:6.16.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.16.1</span>Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered knee-deep with the flowers of the Flame Tree, without gaps even on the filth and rubbish heaps.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I think <i lang="pi" translate="no">sandhi</i> here means “covered without gaps”.</span></span></span> Then the deities and the Mallas of Kusinārā carried the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they entered the town by the northern gate, carried it through the center of the town, left by the eastern gate, and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named Coronation. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.17.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.17.1</span>Then the Mallas said to Ānanda, “Honorable Ānanda, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.17.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.17.3</span>“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.17.4"><span class="parno">dn16:6.17.4</span>“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.17.5"><span class="parno">dn16:6.17.5</span>“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the corpse. They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads. </p>

<p>That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse. Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse. A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.18.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.18.1</span>Then the Mallas ordered their men, “So then, my men, collect uncarded cotton.” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:6.18.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.18.3</span>So the Mallas wrapped the Buddha’s corpse, and placed it in an iron case filled with oil. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they lifted the corpse on to the pyre. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">38. Mahākassapa’s Arrival </h3>



<p id="dn16:6.19.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.19.1</span>Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">With the passing of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Mahākassapa was the most senior of the remaining leading mendicants. As a solitary recluse, it was unusual for him to be travelling with such a large group, or with anyone at all really. He was to cite the events depicted here at the start of the First Council.</span></span></span> Then he left the road and sat at the root of a tree. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.19.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.19.3</span>Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka ascetic had picked up a Flame Tree flower in Kusinārā and was traveling along the road to Pāvā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A follower of the Bamboo-staffed Ascetic Gosāla (<a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:18.1">DN2</a>). <br> This may be an inspiration for the so-called “Flower Sermon”, a medieval Zen story that depicts the Buddha holding up a flower and Mahakassapa smiling.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Mahākassapa saw him coming off in the distance and said to him, “Reverend, might you know about our Teacher?” </p>


<hr>


<p id="dn16:6.19.6"><span class="parno">dn16:6.19.6</span>“Yes, reverend. Seven days ago the ascetic Gotama was fully quenched. From there I picked up this Flame Tree flower.” </p>

<p>Some of the mendicants there who were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Holy One has become fully quenched! Too soon the Eye of the World has vanished!” </p>

<p>But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking, “Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?” </p>



<hr>

<p id="dn16:6.20.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.20.1</span>Now at that time a monk named Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was sitting in that assembly. He said to those mendicants, “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. We’re well rid of that Great Ascetic. And we are oppressed:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc72.html#content">Bhikkhu Pācittiya 72</a>. The syntax is clumsy here, perhaps deliberately so.</span></span></span> ‘This is allowable for you; this is not allowable for you.’ Well, now we shall do what we want and not do what we don’t want.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.20.6"><span class="parno">dn16:6.20.6</span>Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the mendicants, “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.1</span>Now at that time four of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said, “We shall light the Buddha’s funeral pyre.” But they were unable to do so. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.3"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.3</span>The Mallas said to Anuruddha, “What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these four Mallian chiefs are unable to light the Buddha’s funeral pyre?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.6"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.6</span>“Vāseṭṭhas, the deities have a different plan.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.7"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.7</span>“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.8"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.8</span>“The deities’ plan is this: Venerable Mahākassapa is traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. The Buddha’s funeral pyre shall not burn until he bows with his head at the Buddha’s feet.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.21.11"><span class="parno">dn16:6.21.11</span>“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.22.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.22.1</span>Then Venerable Mahākassapa arrived at the Mallian shrine named Coronation at Kusinārā and approached the Buddha’s funeral pyre. Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his joined palms, he respectfully circled the Buddha three times, keeping him on his right, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet. </p>

<p>And the five hundred mendicants did likewise. </p>

<p>And when Mahākassapa and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddha’s funeral pyre burst into flames all by itself. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.23.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.23.1</span>And when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics remained.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here <i lang="pi" translate="no">sarīrāneva</i> is plural and so must mean “relics”, whereas previously it was singular, “corpse”.</span></span></span> It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. In the same way, when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics remained. And of those five hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt: the innermost and the outermost. </p>

<p>But when the Buddha’s corpse was consumed the funeral pyre was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the sky,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As when he was born (<a href="../dn/dn14.html#waters">DN14</a>).</span></span></span> by water dripping from the sal trees, and by the Mallas’ fragrant water. </p>



<p id="dn16:6.23.10"><span class="parno">dn16:6.23.10</span>Then the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddha’s relics in the town hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows. For seven days they honored, respected, revered, and venerated them with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. </p>



<h3 class="subheading">39. Distributing the Relics </h3>



<p id="dn16:6.24.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.24.1</span>King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, heard<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ajātasattu would have learned of the news from spies. It is a 600 km round trip to Rājagaha and back, which a mounted messenger could make in fourteen days.</span></span></span> that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā. He sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “The Buddha was an aristocrat and so am I. I too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A bold move, considering that his designs on the Vajjis were no secret. Perhaps he was seeking a pretext for war. The justification for taking a share of relics is caste, rather than practice of the Dhamma.</span></span></span></p>



<p id="dn16:6.24.5"><span class="parno">dn16:6.24.5</span>The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.

<p id="dn16:6.24.9"><span class="parno">dn16:6.24.9</span>The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also heard that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.

<p id="dn16:6.24.17"><span class="parno">dn16:6.24.17</span>The Koliyans of Rāmagāma also heard<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Koliyans were south-eastern neighbors of the Sakyans, and several of their towns and people feature in the early texts.</span></span></span> that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “The Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics.

<p id="dn16:6.24.25"><span class="parno">dn16:6.24.25</span>The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā.

<p id="dn16:6.25.1"><span class="parno">dn16:6.25.1</span>When they had spoken, the Mallas of Kusinārā said to those various groups: “The Buddha was fully quenched in our village district.

The relative peace that had lasted most of the Buddha’s life was crumbling. We hear of war or threats of war between the Kosalans and the Magadhans, the Magadhans and the Vajjis, the Sakyans and the Koliyans, the Kosalans and the Mallas, and the Kosalans and the Sakyans. It is probably because of the latter two conflicts that Viḍūḍabha—Pasenadi’s son and the newly crowned king of Kosala—did not send an emissary to the funeral. By sparking conflicts with former allies the Sakyans and Mallas, Viḍūḍabha undid the successes of his father and fatally weakened the Kosalan Empire. When the dust cleared a few decades later, all these lands had been consumed by Magadha.</span></span></span> <br/>a share of the supreme person’s relics. </p>

<p id="dn16:6.25.12"><span class="parno">dn16:6.25.12</span>“Well then, brahmin, you yourself should fairly divide the Buddha’s relics in eight portions.” </p>



<p id="dn16:6.25.13"><span class="parno">dn16:6.25.13</span>“Yes, worthy sirs,” replied Doṇa to those various groups.

About a century after these events, Chandragupta the Moriyan, having won the Magadhan crown from the Nandas, proceeded to route the Greeks in the west. His empire, which covered most of northern India, was further expanded to the south by his son Bindusara and grandson Ashoka, under whom the Mauryan Empire became the greatest of all Indian empires. Thus Ajātasattu’s expansionist dreams were ultimately fulfilled beyond his imagining.</span></span></span> that the Buddha had become fully quenched at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “The Buddha was an aristocrat, and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics.

<p id="dn16:6.26.5"><span class="parno">dn16:6.26.5</span>“There is no portion of the Buddha’s relics left, they have already been portioned out. Here, take the embers.” So they took the embers. </p>

Thus there were eight monuments for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers. That is how it was in the old days.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary says this line was added at the Third Council, which was held about 150 years after the Buddha under Ashoka.

In Buddhist cosmology, this agrees with the fact that Sakka’s realm is the third of the heavens (after the earth gods and the four great kings).
