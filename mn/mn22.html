<div lang="en">

<p id="mn22:1.1"><span class="parno">mn22:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>


<p id="mn22:2.1"><span class="parno">mn22:2.1</span>Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For “vulture trapper” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">gaddhabādhi</i>), see <a href="../sn/sn47.7.html#bādh">SN47.7</a> where <i lang="pi" translate="no">√bādh</i> clearly means to “trap” a monkey. The commentary’s “killer” seems unjustified.</span></span></span> “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">By this he denies the third of the four kinds of self-assurance (<a href="../mn/mn12.html#mn12:25.1">MN12:25.1</a>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn22:2.3"><span class="parno">mn22:2.3</span>Several mendicants heard about this. They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him, “Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” </p>

<p id="mn22:3.4"><span class="parno">mn22:3.4</span>“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:3.5"><span class="parno">mn22:3.5</span>Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The stock phrase “pursued, pressed, and grilled” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samanuyuñjanti samanugāhanti samanubhāsanti</i>) is sometimes rendered as if it meant to “question”, but here there is no question. While these terms are commonly used in a context of questioning, they do not, in and of themselves, mean to question. Rather they mean to engage with a person and push for an answer or response. </span></span></span> “Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ariṭṭha makes two mistakes: misunderstanding sensual pleasures, and misrepresenting the Buddha. </span></span></span> In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ariṭṭha did not specify what “obstructions” he was referring to, but this reply by the mendicants indicates that he meant indulgence in sensual pleasures, a conclusion supported by the commentary and several parallel texts. See too <a href="../thi/thi16.1.html#p493">Thig 16 verse 494</a> where sensual pleasures are said to be “obstructive”. Other things said to be obstructive are “possessions, honor, and popularity” (eg. <a href="../sn/sn17.2.html#content">SN17.2</a>) and “false speech”. In the latter context, “obstructive” is explained as preventing the attainment of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> and higher spiritual realizations. </span></span></span> The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. With the similes of a skeleton …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first seven of these ten similes are taught with explanations at <a href="../mn/mn54.html#14.6">MN54:15.1</a>. The full ten are quoted at <a href="../an/an5.76.html#similies">AN5.76</a> and by the bhikkhunī Sumedhā at <a href="../thi/thi16.html#p451">Therigatha 16 verse 452</a>. With slight variations the list recurs in various parallels and some similes are found individually.</span></span></span> a scrap of meat … a grass torch … a pit of glowing coals … a dream … borrowed goods … fruit on a tree … a butcher’s knife and chopping board … swords and spears … a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:3.19"><span class="parno">mn22:3.19</span>But even though the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:3.21"><span class="parno">mn22:3.21</span>When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:5.1"><span class="parno">mn22:5.1</span>So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that the teacher summons him.” </p>

<p id="mn22:5.4"><span class="parno">mn22:5.4</span>“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him, “Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.” </p>

<p id="mn22:5.6"><span class="parno">mn22:5.6</span>“Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:5.7"><span class="parno">mn22:5.7</span>“Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” </p>

<p id="mn22:5.9"><span class="parno">mn22:5.9</span>“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Absolutely” renders the particle <i lang="pi" translate="no">byā</i>, which is a rare intensive form of <i lang="pi" translate="no">iva</i>. It is employed in the same manner by Sāti at <a href="../mn/mn38.html#content">MN38</a>, who is equally confident and equally wrong. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:6.1"><span class="parno">mn22:6.1</span>“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way? Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them? I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. With the similes of a skeleton … a scrap of meat … a grass torch … a pit of glowing coals … a dream … borrowed goods … fruit on a tree … a butcher’s knife and chopping board … swords and spears … a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and brim with much wickedness. This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The discourse up to this point is also found twice in the Vinaya. At <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc68.html#content">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 68</a> the Buddha makes it a confessable offence to persistently insist on a pernicious wrong view of this sort. At <a href="../vi/kd11.html#eject">Khandhaka 11</a> the Buddha asks the Sangha to perform an act of suspension (or “ejection”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">ukkhepanīyakamma</i>) against Ariṭṭha. This portion is also found in the parallel Vinayas of the Dharmaguptaka,Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda schools. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn22:7.1"><span class="parno">mn22:7.1</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “What do you think, mendicants? Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Kindled even a spark of ardor” renders <i lang="pi" translate="no">usmīkatopi</i>, found in a similar context at <a href="../mn/mn38.html#mn38:5.12">MN38:6.1</a>. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Usmā</i> elsewhere appears as bodily warmth (<a href="../mn/mn43.html#mn43:22.7">MN43:22.9</a>, cf. Brahmasūtra 4.2.11), or the initial heating of fire-sticks when rubbed together (<a href="../mn/mn140.html#mn140:19.10">MN140:19.13</a>). But the most pertinent context is Jataka 526:55.4, where a young ascetic will swiftly lose their <i lang="pi" translate="no">usmāgataṁ</i>—explained by the commentary as “the fire of an ascetic” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samaṇatejaṁ</i>)—should they fall prey to sensual temptation. Thus, drawing on the traditional imagery of <i lang="pi" translate="no">tapas</i> as heat and fervor, it refers to the kindling of ascetic ardor. It never became a technical term in Pali, but in Sanskrit Abhidharma, <i lang="pi" translate="no">uṣmagata</i> refers to the conjunction of radiant <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i> with wisdom in the initial realization of the truths, which “burns up” the defilements (Abhidharmakoṣabhāṣya 6.17, Abhidharmasamuccaya 2.4).</span></span></span> </p>


<p id="mn22:7.4"><span class="parno">mn22:7.4</span>“How could that be, sir? No, sir.” </p>
<hr>

<p>When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>

<p id="mn22:7.7"><span class="parno">mn22:7.7</span>Knowing this, the Buddha said, “Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception. I’ll question the mendicants about this.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:8.1"><span class="parno">mn22:8.1</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you understand my teaching as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness?” </p>

<p id="mn22:8.3"><span class="parno">mn22:8.3</span>“No, sir. For in many ways the Buddha has told us that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. With the similes of a skeleton … a snake’s head, the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:8.9"><span class="parno">mn22:8.9</span>“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. For in many ways I have said that obstructive acts are obstructive … </p>

<p id="mn22:8.11"><span class="parno">mn22:8.11</span>I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. But still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness. This will be for his lasting harm and suffering. </p>

<p>Truly, mendicants, it is quite impossible to perform sensual acts without sensual desires, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to the commentary, this refers to sexual intercourse. This sentence is not found in the Chinese parallel at MA 200.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:10.1"><span class="parno">mn22:10.1</span>Take a futile person who memorizes the teaching—statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and elaborations.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These nine categories (<i lang="pi" translate="no">aṅga</i>) of the teaching were an early organization of the Dhamma before the system of <i lang="pi" translate="no">nikāyas</i> (or <i lang="pi" translate="no">āgamas</i>) was introduced at the First Council. While their exact specification is uncertain, in my view they are most likely as follows (with an example of each). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Sutta</i> is short doctrinal statements (<a href="../sn/sn12.1.html#content">SN12.1</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Geyya</i> is mixed prose and verse (“prosimetra”, <a href="../sn/sn1.1.html#content">SN1.1</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Veyyākaraṇa</i> is questions and answers (<a href="../mn/mn22.html#content">MN22</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Gāthā</i> is pure verse (<a href="../thi/thi1.html">Therigatha 1 first verse</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Udāna</i> is the inspired statements identified as such in the early texts (<a href="../mn/mn75.html#mn75:18.4">MN75:19.1</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Itivuttaka</i> perhaps means “legends of the past”  (<a href="../dn/dn27.html#content">DN27</a>) rather than the book of that name (<a href="../it/iti.html">Itivuttaka 1</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Jātaka</i> are the past life stories of the Buddha found in the early texts (<a href="../mn/mn81.html#content">MN81</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Abbhutadhamma</i> are stories of the amazing qualities of the Buddha or disciples (<a href="../mn/mn123.html#content">MN123</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Vedalla</i> are detailed analytical elaborations (<a href="../mn/mn43.html#content">MN43</a>). Once the system of <i lang="pi" translate="no">aṅgas</i> fell into disuse, some names were repurposed as specific books (Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka). Northern traditions, including the parallels to this passage, usually extend the list to twelve with the addition of <i lang="pi" translate="no">nidāna</i> (background stories), <i lang="pi" translate="no">apadāna</i> (past lives of disciples), and <i lang="pi" translate="no">upadesa</i> (explanatory treatises).  </span></span></span> But they don’t examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, and so don’t come to an acceptance of them after deliberation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Considered acceptance” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">nijjhānaṁ khamanti</i>.</span></span></span> They memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This theme is expanded in several discourses of the Aṭṭhakavagga, such as <a href="../sn/snp4.8.html#content">Snp4.8</a>. </span></span></span> They don’t realize the goal for which they memorized them. Because they’re wrongly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering. Why is that? Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.10 says that those who worship ignorance enter darkness, but those who love knowledge (<i lang="pi" translate="no">veda</i>) enter even greater darkness. This is a recurring theme; for example, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.2 tells how Uddālaka saw the vanity of his son Śvetaketu when he returned from his schooling. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn22:10.10"><span class="parno">mn22:10.10</span>Suppose there was a person in need of a cobra. And while wandering in search of a cobra<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The <i lang="pi" translate="no">alagadda</i> appears only here in early Pali. Sanskrit sources identify <i lang="pi" translate="no">alagarda</i> either as a water-snake—in which case, however, it is said to be non-venomous (Kṣīrasvāmin’s Amarakoṣodghāṭana 1.7.5)—or as a kind of cobra (<i lang="pi" translate="no">darvīkāra</i>, Suśrutasaṁhitā 5.4). <br> As to why the man was looking for a cobra, the commentary says he was looking to harvest the snake’s venom. But Candrakīrti, drawing on the pan-Indic legend that certain serpents have a “snake-gem” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nāgamaṇi</i>) in their heads, says that a serpent captured with the proper herbs and incantations brings great riches, but should these fail it will turn deadly (Mūlamadhyamakavṛtti-prasannapadā, L. de La Vallée Poussin’s translation, page 497). </span></span></span> they’d see a big cobra, and grasp it by the coil or the tail. But that cobra would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or other major or minor limb, resulting in death or deadly pain. Why is that? Because of their wrong grasp of the cobra. </p>

They’d see a large deluge, whose near shore was dubious and perilous, while the far shore was a sanctuary free of peril. But there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over. They’d think, ‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’ And so they’d do exactly that. And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think, ‘This raft has been very helpful to me. Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore. Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’ </p>

<p id="mn22:13.17"><span class="parno">mn22:13.17</span>What do you think, mendicants? Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?” </p>

<p id="mn22:13.26"><span class="parno">mn22:13.26</span>In the same way, I have taught a simile of the teaching as a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on. </p>

<p>By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is not the teachings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Dhammā</i> in the plural refers back to “those teachings” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tesaṁ dhammānaṁ</i>) of the nine categories. Accordingly, when this simile is invoked at <a href="../mn/mn38.html#mn38:13.5">MN38:14.1</a>, it is in reference to views. The pair <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhamma</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">adhamma</i> usually means “the teaching” and “what is not the teaching” (eg. <a href="../an/an2.98-117.html#p104">AN2.104</a>).

<p id="mn22:15.1"><span class="parno">mn22:15.1</span>Mendicants, there are these six grounds for views.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Grounds for views” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭhiṭṭhānāni</i>) are the experiences or reasoning from which views are derived. The Buddha is explaining how Ariṭṭha fell into his wrong view. One of the purposes of this analysis is to show how, while divergent views might seem insightful, innovative, or courageous, they all fall back on the same basic fallacies. </span></span></span> What six? Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. They regard form as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The misguided person assumes that one or other of the aggregates is their self. In modern times, the teaching of the aggregates is often presented as a reductive argument: “What you take to be your self is in fact just the aggregates”. But the Buddha’s point is, rather: “The aggregates that you take to be your self do not have the properties of a self,” namely permanence, etc.</span></span></span> They also regard feeling … perception … choices … whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Standing in place of the fifth aggregate, “consciousness”, this includes all kinds of knowledge or spiritual wisdom, especially that gained through mysticism or meditation.</span></span></span> And as for this ground for views: ‘The cosmos and the self are one and the same. After death I will be that, permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a both view and a ground for views. Such views, lacking empirical basis, have something dissatisfying about them, so adherent is driven to develop more and more complex metaphysical abstractions. At <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn1:29.1">DN1:30.1</a>, this is treated as an eternalist view that arises from the grounds of either recollection of past lives or logic. <br> The repeated demonstrative pronouns in the Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">so loko so attā</i> (literally, “This is the cosmos, this is the self”) affirm an emphatic and absolute identity: “The cosmos and the self are one and the same”. This phrase has a lexical parallel at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22, which argues for the renunciate life: “What can descendants do for those for whom the self and the cosmos are one and the same” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ayamātmāyaṁ loka</i>). See also the last words of a father to his son at 1.5.17: “You are divinity, you are the sacrifice, you are the cosmos” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tvaṁ brahma tvaṁ yajñas tvaṁ loka</i>). <br> In this passage the terms <i lang="pi" translate="no">attā</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">loko</i> are reversed, presumably by textual error. It does not affect the meaning. </span></span></span> They regard this also as: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ </p>

<p id="mn22:16.1"><span class="parno">mn22:16.1</span>But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones.

In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The particle <i lang="pi" translate="no">c’eva</i> here has its normal role of slight emphasis in conjunctions, and so this phrase does not mean, “I <em>only</em> teach suffering and the end of suffering”. The point, rather, is that when he speaks of cessation, it is the cessation of suffering, not the cessation of an “existing being”.  </span></span></span> This being so, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the Realized One, he doesn’t get resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated. </p>

The latter reading is supported by BJT’s <i lang="pi" translate="no">tatrime</i>, but I think this is probably a backreading from the commentary. In the parallel phrase for the monks below, we would expect <i lang="pi" translate="no">tattha no</i>, which is in fact attested in the Thai and PTS editions, so I translate “us” accordingly.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn22:39.1"><span class="parno">mn22:39.1</span>So, mendicants, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble you, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated. Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate you, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited. If they praise you, just think, ‘They do such things for us regarding what in the past was completely understood.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This seems out of place here, for “completely understood” refers to arahantship, yet as a general teaching this should include everyone. In the Chinese parallel at MA 200, after being abused, one reflects that it is due to past deeds, and after being praised, one reflects that it is due to present knowledge and elimination of defilements. Anālayo (<em>Comparative Study</em>, pp. 56–7) suggests that the Pali phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">pubbe pariññātaṁ</i> might be a conflation of these two ideas due to a textual confusion which also left the Pali without a reflection on being abused. While this must remain conjectural, it is a neat explanation for the several doctrinal and textual problems of this passage. </span></span></span> </p>
