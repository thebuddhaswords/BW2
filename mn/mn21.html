<div lang="en">

<p id="mn21:1.1"><span class="parno">mn21:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>

<p id="mn21:2.1"><span class="parno">mn21:2.1</span>Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was spending too long mixing closely with some nuns.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This monk appears in three discourses, in none of which he distinguishes himself. At <a href="../sn/sn12.12.html#content">SN12.12</a> he persistently attempts to rephrase questions on dependent origination in terms of a self. And at <a href="../sn/sn12.32.html#content">SN12.32</a> Venerable Sāriputta gets word that Phagguna had disrobed. According to the commentary, he was called Phagguna “of the Top-Knot” because of the style he wore his hair as a layperson. The name stuck, presumably to distinguish him from the Phagguna of <a href="../an/an6.56.html#content">AN6.56</a> (and probably <a href="../sn/sn35.83.html#content">SN35.83</a>) who died in robes as a non-returner after hearing a Dhamma talk. </span></span></span> So much so that if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A “disciplinary proceeding” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhikaraṇa</i>) is a legal case in Vinaya. A standard set of four is listed at <a href="../mn/mn104.html#mn104:7-11.1">MN104:12.1</a>. The kind of case is not specified in the text, but the commentary says they accused other mendicants of various offences and got Vinaya experts to litigate them, making it a “disciplinary issue arising from accusations” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anuvādādhikaraṇa</i>, <a href="../vi/kd14.html#legalissues">Khandhaka 14</a>).</span></span></span> And if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the Top-Knot in their presence, those nuns got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings. That’s how close Phagguna of the Top-Knot was with those nuns. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:3.1"><span class="parno">mn21:3.1</span>Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was going on. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:4.1"><span class="parno">mn21:4.1</span>So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that the teacher summons him.” </p>

<p id="mn21:4.4"><span class="parno">mn21:4.4</span>“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot and said to him, “Reverend Phagguna, the teacher summons you.” </p>

<p id="mn21:4.6"><span class="parno">mn21:4.6</span>“Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>

<p id="mn21:5.1"><span class="parno">mn21:5.1</span>“Is it really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been spending too long mixing closely with some nuns? So much so that if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings? And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings? Is that how close you’ve become with those nuns?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:5.6"><span class="parno">mn21:5.6</span>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="mn21:5.7"><span class="parno">mn21:5.7</span>“Phagguna, are you not a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness?” </p>

<p id="mn21:5.8"><span class="parno">mn21:5.8</span>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:6.1"><span class="parno">mn21:6.1</span>“As such, it’s not appropriate for you to mix so closely with those nuns. So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life. If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’ That’s how you should train. </p>

<p id="mn21:6.6"><span class="parno">mn21:6.6</span>So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This does not mean, of course, that one should not defend people against violence (see eg. <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:1.4.14">DN16:1.4.15</a>), but that even in such circumstances one should not give way to anger. </span></span></span> If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’ That’s how you should train. </p>

<p id="mn21:6.10"><span class="parno">mn21:6.10</span>So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The grammar here is a little tricky. The genitive plays two roles in these passages: specifying the context (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tava sammukhā</i>, “in your presence”), and as the object of criticism or blows (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pahāraṁ dadeyya</i> “if they strike” operates above on “those nuns” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tāsaṁ bhikkhunīnaṁ</i>) and below on “you” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tava</i>)). Here we would expect both senses to be used, but the text only has <i lang="pi" translate="no">tava</i> once. I assume that either one instance of <i lang="pi" translate="no">tava</i> has been lost or it is meant to be distributed. </span></span></span> If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’ That’s how you should train. </p>

<p id="mn21:6.13"><span class="parno">mn21:6.13</span>So Phagguna, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of domestic life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here <i lang="pi" translate="no">sammukhā</i> is omitted, as it is unnecessary to specify being hit in your own presence.</span></span></span> If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will not degenerate. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:7.1"><span class="parno">mn21:7.1</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: </p>

<p id="mn21:7.2"><span class="parno">mn21:7.2</span>“Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants. Once, I addressed them: ‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Eating once a day is also encouraged at <a href="../mn/mn65.html#content">MN65</a>, while <a href="../mn/mn70.html#content">MN70</a> encourages not eating at night. In both cases, monks objected when asked to follow this practice. Thus all three instances depict the growing influence of recalcitrant monks in the Sangha, culminating in the Buddha laying down a formal Vinaya rule against eating at the wrong time (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc37.html#content">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 37</a>). Per the allowance at <a href="../mn/mn65.html#mn65:4.1">MN65:4.1</a>, the mendicants are not required to eat in one sitting, which remained as an optional ascetic practice. </span></span></span> Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. You too should eat your food in one sitting per day. Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’ I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants; I just had to prompt their mindfulness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is referring to the early years of the dispensation, before the formal Vinaya code was laid down. The Buddha was reluctant to create a legal code and did so only when it became necessary (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj1.html#rules">Bhikkhu Pārājika 1</a>). He preferred to lead without judgment and punishment, but by reason, positive encouragement, and inspiring with his own example. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn21:7.10"><span class="parno">mn21:7.10</span>Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This simile is also at <a href="../mn/mn119.html#mn119:30.1">MN119:30.4</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.239.html#chariot">SN35.239</a>, and <a href="../an/an5.28.html#chariot">AN5.28:10.2</a>. </span></span></span> A deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes. </p>

<p id="mn21:7.12"><span class="parno">mn21:7.12</span>In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants; I just had to prompt their mindfulness. So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities. In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:8.1"><span class="parno">mn21:8.1</span>Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a unique simile.</span></span></span> that was choked with castor-oil weeds. Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove. They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove, and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings. In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature. </p>

<p id="mn21:8.7"><span class="parno">mn21:8.7</span>In the same way, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities. In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training. </p>

<p id="mn21:9.1"><span class="parno">mn21:9.1</span>Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The lady Vedehikā is known only here. According to the commentary, her name means either “daughter of the lady from Videha”, or (implausibly) “wise one”. However, the much earlier Arthaśāstra treats <i lang="pi" translate="no">vaidehika</i> either as a “merchant” (2.21.7) or as a caste name (3.7.32). This story paints a rare portrait of domestic life.</span></span></span> She had this good reputation: ‘The housewife Vedehikā is gentle, even-tempered, and calm.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The same set of three in a similar context occur at <a href="../an/an6.60.html#content">AN6.60</a>.</span></span></span> Now, Vedehikā had a bonded maid named Kāḷī who was deft, tireless, and well-organized in her work.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to ancient Indian law (Arthaśāstra 3.13), slaves may be born such, be captured in war, or a person in a time of trouble may bind themselves in service for a fee. Non-Aryans (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mleccha</i>) may indenture their children, but this is forbidden for Aryans. Such bondservants were protected against cruelty, sexual abuse, and unfair work. After earning back the fee of their indenture they were freed, retaining their original inheritance and status. <br>
The maid’s name means “black” (compare the Kāḷī at <a href="../tha/tha2.html#kali">Theragatha 2</a> who “looks like a crow”). This is a persistent pattern in early Pali. The only other named slaves are Disā (“foe”, <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.15.16">DN3:1.16.1</a>), her son Kaṇha (“black”, <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.15.16"> in the same verse</a>), and Kāka (“crow”, <a href="../vi/kd8.html#Kāka">Khandhaka 8</a>). These people were evidently non-Aryans descended from the native peoples of India, perhaps Tamils or other tribal groups.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:9.5"><span class="parno">mn21:9.5</span>Then Kāḷī thought, ‘My mistress has a good reputation as being gentle, even-tempered, and calm. But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger? Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside? Why don’t I test my mistress?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">To “test” (or “inquire”) is <i lang="pi" translate="no">vīmaṁsā</i>, which features as the fourth of the bases of psychic power. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr><a id="wench"></a>

<p id="mn21:9.11"><span class="parno">mn21:9.11</span>So Kāḷī got up during the day. Vedehikā said to her, ‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">He je</i> is an idiomatic and disrespectful form of address, offering a glimpse of colloquial speech in the formal Pali of scripture. <i lang="pi" translate="no">He</i> is an exclamation for calling attention, like “hey” but cruder. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Je</i> is a derogatory term for women, used here and by the Vajjīs to Ambapālī at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:2.15.1">DN16:2.16.1</a>. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:9.14"><span class="parno">mn21:9.14</span>‘What is it, ma’am?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">She uses the respectful address <i lang="pi" translate="no">ayye</i> (“ma’am”).</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn21:9.15"><span class="parno">mn21:9.15</span>‘You’re getting up in the day—what’s up with you, wench?’ </p>

<p id="mn21:9.16"><span class="parno">mn21:9.16</span>‘Nothing, ma’am.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:9.17"><span class="parno">mn21:9.17</span>‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:9.18"><span class="parno">mn21:9.18</span>Then Kāḷī thought, ‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger. It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside. Why don’t I test my mistress further?’ </p>

<p id="mn21:9.22"><span class="parno">mn21:9.22</span>So Kāḷī got up later in the day. Vedehikā said to her, ‘Oi wench, Kāḷī!’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn21:9.28"><span class="parno">mn21:9.28</span>‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words. </p>

<hr>
<a id="whatthehell"></a>
<p id="mn21:9.29"><span class="parno">mn21:9.29</span>Then Kāḷī thought, ‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.

<p id="mn21:9.39"><span class="parno">mn21:9.39</span>‘Oh, so nothing’s up, you naughty maid, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a door-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Aggaḷasūci</i> is a “pin” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sūci</i>) for fastening the “door” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">aggala</i>).

<p id="mn21:9.40"><span class="parno">mn21:9.40</span>Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors, ‘See, ladies, what the gentle one did!

<p id="mn21:10.1"><span class="parno">mn21:10.1</span>In the same way, a mendicant may be the gentlest of the gentle, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism. But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really gentle, even-tempered, and calm. I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Why is that? Because when they don’t get robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish. But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish. So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching.’ That’s how you should train. </p>
