<h3>MN36: Mahāsaccaka Sutta — The Longer Discourse With Saccaka</h3>

<section class="raw_sutta">

<div lang="en">

<p id="mn36:1.1"><span class="parno">mn36:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>

<p id="mn36:2.1"><span class="parno">mn36:2.1</span>Now at that time in the morning the Buddha, being properly dressed, took his bowl and robe, wishing to enter Vesālī for alms. </p>

<p id="mn36:3.1"><span class="parno">mn36:3.1</span>Then as Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse appears to be set after the previous. In both suttas, while Saccaka is impressed by the Buddha, he does not go for refuge or indicate that he has been persuaded by his teachings. </span></span></span> Venerable Ānanda saw him coming off in the distance, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, is coming. He’s a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people. He wants to discredit the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. Please, sir, sit for an hour out of sympathy.” The Buddha sat on the seat spread out. </p>

<p id="mn36:3.8"><span class="parno">mn36:3.8</span>Then Saccaka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, </p>

<p id="mn36:4.1"><span class="parno">mn36:4.1</span>“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance, without developing the mind.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Development of physical endurance” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāyabhāvanā</i>, which is not a normal Buddhist term. It is introduced by Saccaka here and collected in <a href="../dn/dn33.html#dn33:1.10.117">DN33:1.10.116</a>. The literal meaning is “development of the body”, but I translate in accord with the sense. </span></span></span> They suffer painful physical feelings. This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind. Their mind was subject to the body, and the body had power over it. Why is that? Because their mind was not developed. There are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance. They suffer painful mental feelings. This happened to someone once. Their thighs became paralyzed, their heart burst, hot blood gushed from their mouth, and they went mad and lost their mind. Their body was subject to the mind, and the mind had power over it. Why is that? Because their physical endurance was not developed.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka’s question shows he was aware of the danger of pursuing of extreme practices and the need for balance. It remains the case today that imbalanced and excessive practices lead to physical and mental breakdowns. </span></span></span> It occurs to me that The worthy Gotama’s disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind, without developing physical endurance.” </p>

<p id="mn36:5.1"><span class="parno">mn36:5.1</span>“But Aggivessana, what have you heard about the development of physical endurance?” </p>

<p id="mn36:5.2"><span class="parno">mn36:5.2</span>“Take, for example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Described as prominent sages of the Ājīvakas at <a href="../mn/mn76.html#mn76:53.2">MN76:53.3</a> and <a href="../an/an6.57.html#p5">AN6.57</a>. Gosāla was one of the oft-mentioned six ascetic teachers (see below at <a href="#mn36:48.7">MN36:48.7</a>), while the other two are unknown outside of these passing mentions. But the phrasing of this passage suggests that they too, like Gosāla, were contemporaries of the Buddha.</span></span></span> They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The earliest Jain text speaks of Mahāvīra eating “only every sixth meal, or eighth, or tenth, or twelfth” (Ācāraṅgasūtra 1.8.4.7). </span></span></span> </p>




<p id="mn36:6.1"><span class="parno">mn36:6.1</span>“But Aggivessana, do they get by on so little?” </p>

<p id="mn36:6.2"><span class="parno">mn36:6.2</span>“No, worthy Gotama. Sometimes they eat luxury fresh and cooked foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages. They gather their body’s strength, build it up, and get fat.” </p>

<p id="mn36:6.5"><span class="parno">mn36:6.5</span>“What they earlier gave up, they later got back. That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body. But Aggivessana, what have you heard about development of the mind?” When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind, he was stumped.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While pre-Buddhist texts describe a contemplative and reflective culture, they do not contain clear instructions for meditation. It seems that the practice of explicitly teaching meditation methods was an innovation of the Buddha. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn36:7.1"><span class="parno">mn36:7.1</span>So the Buddha said to Saccaka, “The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble one’s training. And since you don’t even understand the development of physical endurance, how can you possibly understand the development of the mind? Still, as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind, and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>

<p id="mn36:7.6"><span class="parno">mn36:7.6</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Saccaka. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn36:8.1"><span class="parno">mn36:8.1</span>“And how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mind? Take an unlearned ordinary person who has a pleasant feeling. When they experience a pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it. Then that pleasant feeling ceases. And when it ceases, a painful feeling arises. When they suffer painful feeling, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Because their physical endurance is undeveloped, pleasant feelings occupy the mind. And because their mind is undeveloped, painful feelings occupy the mind. Anyone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped both in physical endurance and in mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:9.1"><span class="parno">mn36:9.1</span>And how is someone developed in physical endurance and mind? Take a learned noble disciple who has a pleasant feeling. When they experience a pleasant feeling they don’t become full of lust for it. Then that pleasant feeling ceases. And when it ceases, painful feeling arises. When they suffer painful feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Because their physical endurance is developed, pleasant feelings don’t occupy the mind. And because their mind is developed, painful feelings don’t occupy the mind. Anyone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed both in physical endurance and in mind.” </p>

<p id="mn36:10.1"><span class="parno">mn36:10.1</span>“I am quite confident that the worthy Gotama is developed in physical endurance and in mind.” </p>

<p id="mn36:10.3"><span class="parno">mn36:10.3</span>“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, Aggivessana.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a standard response to someone making unwarranted assumptions about personal spiritual development (<a href="../an/an3.60.html#p18">AN3.60</a>, <a href="../an/an4.35.html#p5">AN4.35</a>, <a href="../mn/mn127.html#mn127:17.3">MN127:17.8</a>). </span></span></span> Nevertheless, I will answer you. Ever since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mind.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha is not speaking about enlightenment, but about his determination to persevere. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn36:11.1"><span class="parno">mn36:11.1</span>“Worthy Gotama mustn’t have experienced the kind of pleasant or painful feelings that would occupy the mind.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For the idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">na hi nūna</i>, compare <a href="../an/an8.86.html#p5">AN8.86</a> and <a href="../an/an4.67.html#p2">AN4.67</a>.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn36:12.1"><span class="parno">mn36:12.1</span>“How could I not, Aggivessana? Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ </p>

<p id="mn36:13.1"><span class="parno">mn36:13.1</span>Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>

<p id="mn36:13.2"><span class="parno">mn36:13.2</span>Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../mn/mn26.html#mn26:14.1">MN26:14.1</a> ff. for notes. </span></span></span> ‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:13.4"><span class="parno">mn36:13.4</span>Āḷāra Kālāma replied, ‘Stay, venerable. This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:13.7"><span class="parno">mn36:13.7</span>I quickly memorized that teaching. As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. </p>

<p id="mn36:13.9"><span class="parno">mn36:13.9</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:13.12"><span class="parno">mn36:13.12</span>So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’ When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness. </p>

<p id="mn36:13.15"><span class="parno">mn36:13.15</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom; I too have these things. Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’ I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. </p>

<p id="mn36:14.1"><span class="parno">mn36:14.1</span>So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’ </p>


<a id="realised"></a>

<p id="mn36:14.3"><span class="parno">mn36:14.3</span>‘I have, reverend.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:14.4"><span class="parno">mn36:14.4</span>‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:14.5"><span class="parno">mn36:14.5</span>‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it. The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it. So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know. I am like you and you are like me. Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’

<a id="nothingness"></a>

And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with high praise. </p>

<p id="mn36:14.13"><span class="parno">mn36:14.13</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’ Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. </p>

<p id="mn36:15.1"><span class="parno">mn36:15.1</span>I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him, ‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:15.3"><span class="parno">mn36:15.3</span>Uddaka replied, ‘Stay, venerable. This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:15.6"><span class="parno">mn36:15.6</span>I quickly memorized that teaching. As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. </p>

<p id="mn36:15.8"><span class="parno">mn36:15.8</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:15.11"><span class="parno">mn36:15.11</span>So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him, ‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’ When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. </p>

<p id="mn36:15.14"><span class="parno">mn36:15.14</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom; I too have these things. Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’ I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. </p>

<p id="mn36:15.22"><span class="parno">mn36:15.22</span>So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him, ‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’ </p>

<p id="mn36:15.24"><span class="parno">mn36:15.24</span>‘He had, reverend.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:15.25"><span class="parno">mn36:15.25</span>‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:15.26"><span class="parno">mn36:15.26</span>‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! The teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you have realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it. The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it. So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew. Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma. Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’ </p>

<p>And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a tutor and honored me with high praise. </p>

<p id="mn36:15.33"><span class="parno">mn36:15.33</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. </p>

<p id="mn36:16.1"><span class="parno">mn36:16.1</span>I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā. There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms. </p>

<p>Then it occurred to me, ‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms. This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’ So I sat down right there, thinking: ‘This is good enough for striving.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:17.1"><span class="parno">mn36:17.1</span>And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../mn/mn85.html#mn85:14.3">MN85:15.1</a> and <a href="../mn/mn100.html#mn100:13.1">MN100:14.1</a>.

Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking to light a fire and produce heat. What do you think, Aggivessana?

<p id="mn36:17.7"><span class="parno">mn36:17.7</span>“No, worthy Gotama. Why not? Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water. That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.” </p>

<p id="mn36:17.11"><span class="parno">mn36:17.11</span>“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures.

Regardless of whether or not they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening. This was the first example that occurred to me. </p>

<p id="mn36:18.1"><span class="parno">mn36:18.1</span>Then a second example occurred to me. Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water. Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking to light a fire and produce heat. What do you think, Aggivessana?

<p id="mn36:19.1"><span class="parno">mn36:19.1</span>Then a third example occurred to me. Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water. Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking to light a fire and produce heat. What do you think, Aggivessana?

<p id="mn36:20.1"><span class="parno">mn36:20.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This, the most gentle of the austere practices, was occasionally recommended by the Buddha as a last resort (<a href="../mn/mn20.html#mn20:6.22">MN20:7.1</a>). </span></span></span> So that’s what I did, until sweat ran from my armpits. It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them. In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:21.1"><span class="parno">mn36:21.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This practice seems like an extreme form of “breath control” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">prāṇayāma</i>) which was a prominent feature of later Yoga. While the breath played an extremely important role in pre-Buddhist texts, no corresponding practice is detailed. However, precursors may be seen in passages such as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7.16, where in response to Uddālaka’s question, Yājnavalkya says, “He who controls the breath within is the self, the inner controller, the immortal” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yaḥ prāṇamantaro yamayati, eṣa ta ātmāntaryāmyamṛtaḥ</i>). Jaiminīya Brāhmaņa 1.42 describes a practice of deliberate asphyxiation to induce a near-death experience. Varuṇa deprived his son Bhṛgu of breath in order to send him on a journey to the “other world”. There Bhṛgu saw men cutting other men to pieces and eating them, and other sights both horrifying and beautiful, all the while wondering if what he saw was real, before his breath was returned to him. </span></span></span> So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose. But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise, like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:22.1"><span class="parno">mn36:22.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. But then strong winds ground my head, like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:23.1"><span class="parno">mn36:23.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. But then I got a severe headache, like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:24.1"><span class="parno">mn36:24.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. But then strong winds carved up my belly, like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:25.1"><span class="parno">mn36:25.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. But then there was a severe burning in my body, like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:26.1"><span class="parno">mn36:26.1</span>Then some deities saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’ Others said, ‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’ Others said, ‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:27.1"><span class="parno">mn36:27.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’ But deities came to me and said, ‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food. If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’ Then I thought, ‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing heavenly nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’ So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:28.1"><span class="parno">mn36:28.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’ So that’s what I did, until my body became severely emaciated. Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man, my bottom became like a camel’s hoof, my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string, and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn. Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well. Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:28.11"><span class="parno">mn36:28.11</span>Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly. Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there. Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out. </p>

<p id="mn36:29.1"><span class="parno">mn36:29.1</span>Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’ Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’ Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’ That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food. </p>

<p id="mn36:30.1"><span class="parno">mn36:30.1</span>Then I thought, ‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this. But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work. Could there be another path to awakening?’ </p>

<p id="mn36:31.1"><span class="parno">mn36:31.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The gentle and pleasant practice of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> is contrasted with the fiery austerities. The Bodhisatta had previously developed meditation under his former teachers, which included the practice of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. But there the practice was embedded in theory, since he first memorized scripture, which would have taught him that such states were a revelation of the true self as the cosmic divinity of sheer consciousness. Thus what he rejected was “that teaching”, i.e. the system of philosophy and practice as a whole, which leads only to rebirth in a realm that, for all its sublimity, is still conditioned. Now he recalls entering deep meditation with the innocence of youth, following no system or philosophy. This showed him that peace of mind is a natural process of letting go, not dependent on (Upaniṣadic) metaphysics.</span></span></span> Could that be the path to awakening?’ </p>

<p id="mn36:31.4"><span class="parno">mn36:31.4</span>Stemming from that memory came the understanding: ‘<em>That</em> is the path to awakening!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Compare <a href="../dhp/dhp273-289.html#p273">Dhammapada verse 274</a>. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:32.1"><span class="parno">mn36:32.1</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’ Then I thought, ‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:33.1"><span class="parno">mn36:33.1</span>Then I thought, ‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so severely emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The dependence of the mind on food was proven by Uddālaka when he asked Śvetaketu to go without food for fifteen days, after which he could not recall any of the hymns (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.7). <br>
Note how this contrasts with the unhealthy cycle of starving and fattening described above (<a href="#mn36:6.1">MN36:6.1 above</a>).</span></span></span> So I ate some solid food. </p>

<p id="mn36:33.4"><span class="parno">mn36:33.4</span>Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking, ‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’ But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying, ‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:34.1"><span class="parno">mn36:34.1</span>After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:35-37.1"><span class="parno">mn36:35-37.1</span>As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind. And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind. With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind. </p>

<p id="mn36:38.1"><span class="parno">mn36:38.1</span>When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>

<p id="mn36:39.1"><span class="parno">mn36:39.1</span>This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.

<p id="mn36:40.1"><span class="parno">mn36:40.1</span>When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds. </p>

<p id="mn36:41.1"><span class="parno">mn36:41.1</span>This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and knowledge arose; darkness was banished and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.

<p id="mn36:42.1"><span class="parno">mn36:42.1</span>When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn36:43.1"><span class="parno">mn36:43.1</span>Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed. </p>

<p id="mn36:43.3"><span class="parno">mn36:43.3</span>I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.’ </p>

<p id="mn36:44.1"><span class="parno">mn36:44.1</span>This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and knowledge arose; darkness was banished and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.

<p id="mn36:45.1"><span class="parno">mn36:45.1</span>Aggivessana, I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage is unique and its purpose here unclear, </span></span></span> and each person thought that I was teaching the Dhamma especially for them. But it should not be seen like this. The Realized One teaches others only so that they can understand.

<hr>

<p id="mn36:46.7"><span class="parno">mn36:46.7</span>The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn36:47.1"><span class="parno">mn36:47.1</span>“Anyone who has not given up the defilements that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death is deluded, I say.

<a id="dodge"></a>
<p id="mn36:48.1"><span class="parno">mn36:48.1</span>When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him, “It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing!
