<p id="mn7:1.1"><span class="parno">mn7:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn7:1.5"><span class="parno">mn7:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:2.1"><span class="parno">mn7:2.1</span>“Suppose, mendicants, there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled. No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look poorly dyed and impure in color. Why is that? Because of the impurity of the cloth. </p>

<p id="mn7:2.5"><span class="parno">mn7:2.5</span>In the same way, when the mind is corrupt, a bad destiny is to be expected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A “bad destiny” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">duggati</i>) is any realm below the human, namely the animal, ghost, and hell realms. </span></span></span> Suppose there was a cloth that was pure and clean. No matter what dye the dyer applied—whether blue or yellow or red or magenta—it would look well dyed and pure in color. Why is that? Because of the purity of the cloth. </p>

<p id="mn7:2.10"><span class="parno">mn7:2.10</span>In the same way, when the mind isn’t corrupt, a good destiny is to be expected. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:3.1"><span class="parno">mn7:3.1</span>And what are the corruptions of the mind?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the text shifts from <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkiliṭṭha</i> (“corrupt”) to <i lang="pi" translate="no">upakkilesa</i> (“corruption”). These are general terms for unskillful qualities of mind and the change in prefix has no particular significence. </span></span></span> Covetousness and immoral greed, ill will, anger, acrimony, disdain, contempt, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, deviousness, obstinacy, aggression, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence are corruptions of the mind. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:4.1"><span class="parno">mn7:4.1</span>A mendicant who understands that covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind gives them up. A mendicant who understands that ill will … negligence is a corruption of the mind gives it up. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:5.1"><span class="parno">mn7:5.1</span>When they have understood these corruptions of the mind for what they are, and have given them up, they have experiential confidence in the Buddha:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Experiential” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">avecca</i>, literally “having undergone”. “Experiential confidence” is the faith of a stream-enterer, who has seen for themselves. </span></span></span> ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">They have experiential confidence in the Buddha as a teacher because they have followed his path and realized the results that he speaks of.  </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:6.1"><span class="parno">mn7:6.1</span>They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A stream-enterer has direct experience of the four noble truths, so they have confirmed that the teaching is indeed realizable in this very life.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:7.1"><span class="parno">mn7:7.1</span>They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The suttas distinguish between two senses of Saṅgha. The “mendicant Saṅgha” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhusaṅgha</i>) is the conventional community of monks and nuns. The “Saṅgha of disciples” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sāvakasaṅgha</i>) is classified as fourfold according to the stages of awakening: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection. Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit who have realized. These are referred to as “noble disciples”, four of the path and four of the fruit, making eight individuals in total. Saṅgha is not used in the sense of “spiritual community”. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn7:8.1"><span class="parno">mn7:8.1</span>When a mendicant has discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent, thinking, ‘I have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching. Thinking: ‘I have discarded, eliminated, released, given up, and relinquished to this extent,’ they find inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reflection on one’s progress brings joy and spurs further progress. This can be so powerful as to be a basis for <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:12.1"><span class="parno">mn7:12.1</span>When a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An offering of delicious food is normally the most sensual temptation in a mendicant’s day. In the Chinese parallel at EA 13.5, this is mentioned only after arahantship.</span></span></span> Compare with cloth that is dirty and soiled; it can be made pure and clean by pure water. Or native gold, which can be made pure and bright by a forge. In the same way, when a mendicant of such ethics, such qualities, and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, that is no obstacle for them. </p>

<p id="mn7:13.1"><span class="parno">mn7:13.1</span>They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> **Here the Buddha introduces the so-called “divine meditations” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmavihāra</i>) or “immeasurables” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">appamañña</i>). These are four wholesome emotional states that can be developed as a basis for <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>. They were evidently pre-Buddhist, although they have not been traced as a group in pre-Buddhist texts. However, they are shared with later non-Buddhist texts such as  Yogasūtra 1.33 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7.11. <br> “Love” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mettā</i>) is a universal positive regard and well-wishing free of personal desires or attachments.</span></span></span> They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> “Compassion” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">karuṇā</i>) is the quality of empathy with the suffering of another or oneself and the wish to remove it.</span></span></span> They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> “Rejoicing” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">muditā</i>) is joyful celebration in the success of others or oneself, free of jealousy or cynicism.</span></span></span> They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> Equanimity (<i lang="pi" translate="no">upekkhā</i>) is literally “close watching”, not interfering but standing ready when needed. It is not indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end, after the positive emotions are developed.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:17.1"><span class="parno">mn7:17.1</span>They understand: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a description of advanced insight by a stream-enterer. The meditator understands the current state of their experience, namely the mind developed through <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>. They know that this is conditioned and hence liable to decline to a lower state “worse than this”. They know that there are still higher states of mind that can be developed. And they know that, while all states of meditation fall within the scope of perception, there is an ultimate escape, namely Nibbāna.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn7:18.1"><span class="parno">mn7:18.1</span>Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>

<p id="mn7:18.3"><span class="parno">mn7:18.3</span>They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ This is called a mendicant who is bathed with the inner bathing.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Bathed” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">sināta</i>, a rare variant spelling of <i lang="pi" translate="no">nhata</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">snāta</i>. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Sināta</i> also occurs at <a href="../sn/sn7.9.html#sinātā">SN7.9</a>). <br> Later Brahmanical texts regarded external bathing as spiritually effective only when accompanied by inner bathing or purity of soul. The Mahābhārata says that “he who is bathed in the bath of self-disciple is clean inside and out” (13.111.9c, <i lang="pi" translate="no">sa snāto yo damasnātaḥ sabāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ</i>), while the Liṅga-purāṇa (1.8.33) insists that one who has bathed externally “must also practice the inner bathing” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">snānaṁ … ābhyantaraṁ caret</i>).</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn7:19.1"><span class="parno">mn7:19.1</span>Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā was sitting not far from the Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It seems that the Buddha mentioned the inner bathing to provoke the brahmin. <br>
Four of the six Chinese parallels to this passage situate it on the bank of a river. </span></span></span> He said to the Buddha, “But does the worthy Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to bathe?” </p>

<p id="mn7:19.4"><span class="parno">mn7:19.4</span>“Brahmin, why go to the river Bāhuka? What can the river Bāhuka do?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn7:19.6"><span class="parno">mn7:19.6</span>“Many people deem that the river Bāhukā leads to a heavenly world and bestows merit. And many people wash off their bad deeds in the river Bāhukā.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Lokkha</i>, elsewhere unattested in Pali, is Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">lokya</i>, which occurs several times in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in the sense “conducive to a (heavenly) world” (9.5.2.16, 10.5.2.12, 11.3.3.7). The root sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">loka</i> is “light” and it was originally the bright sky with its <i lang="pi" translate="no">devas</i> (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa Mādyandina 11.2.3.1–6, Kāṇva 3.2.5.1), later being extended to include all worlds. The PTS reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">mokkha</i> is an unwarranted normalization, although it is supported by the parallel at MA 93, which has <span lang="lzh">度</span>. Note that the expected form <i lang="pi" translate="no">lokiya</i>, although common in later Pali, occurs only in one early verse (<a href="../tha/tha2.html#lokiya">Theragatha 2 verse 156</a>). <br>
Bathing for purity from misdeeds as a pre-Buddhist Brahmanical custom is attested in Śukla Yajurveda 3.48. The bhikkhunī Puṇṇikā pointed out that if this were true then the fish, frogs, and turtles would go to heaven (<a href="../thi/thi12.html#washed">Therigatha 12 verse 239+</a>); her argument was echoed by the Jains (Sūyagaḍa 1.7.14–16) and later Brahmins (Liṅga-purāṇa 1.8.33–4). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn7:20.1"><span class="parno">mn7:20.1</span>Then the Buddha addressed Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
	<p id="mn7:20.2"><span class="parno">mn7:20.2</span>“The Bāhukā and the Adhikakkā,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Bāhukā (variant Bahukā) is mentioned only here. It may be the Bāhudā found in various Sanskrit texts (Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.19.18), both words having the sense “granter of abundance”. <br> Adhikakkā (variant Avikakkā) is mentioned only here. The commentary says it was a ford (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tittha</i>).  </span></span></span> <br/>at Gayā and the Sundarikā too,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gayā is a ford on the Phalgu River by the town of Gayā, which is still a popular site for sacred bathing. <br>
	Sundarikā was a river in Kosala used for Brahmanical rituals (<a href="../sn/sn7.9.html#content">SN7.9</a>, <a href="../sn/snp3.4.html#content">Snp3.4</a>). Bathing in the ford there was said to bring beauty (Mahābhārata 3.82.51).</span></span></span> <br/>
	Sarasvatī and Payāga,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">sarassatī</i> is better known in the Sanskrit form <i lang="pi" translate="no">sarasvatī</i>, the most prominent river of the Vedas, who “like a snorting boar, broke the back of the mountains with her mighty waves” (Rig Veda 6.61.2). Change stole her waters and today she is lost. Researchers have identified her with the now-residual Ghaggar-Hakra system in north-west India and Pakistan or the Helmand River in Afghanistan. <br>
	Payāga (modern Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad) is the sacred ford at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā beside Kosambī (see <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj1.html#Payāga">Bhikkhu Pārājika 1</a>). The Mahābhārata calls it the “vulva of the world” (3.83.71), the most meritorious of all fords, where bathing can wash away a hundred crimes (3.83.82). </span></span></span> <br/>
	and the river Bāhumatī:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Bāhumatī River is elsewhere only known by a passing mention in Sanskrit reference works. As an epithet of Indra it means “strong of arm”.</span></span></span> <br/>

<p id="mn7:21.1"><span class="parno">mn7:21.1</span>When he had spoken, the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā said to the Buddha, “Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?” </p>

<p id="mn7:22.1"><span class="parno">mn7:22.1</span>And the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>

<p id="mn7:22.3"><span class="parno">mn7:22.3</span>He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. </p>
