<p id="mn26:1.1"><span class="parno">mn26:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse is known in Pali manuscripts and commentaries either as “The Noble Quest” or “The Pile of Snares”, whereas the Chinese parallel at MA 204 is titled “The Discourse at Rāma’s Hermitage”. It is one of several discourses in the Majjhima that include a partial account of Siddhattha’s practice before awakening, an account that became one of the key events in the Buddha’s biography. This particular version focuses on his experience with Brahmanical teachers, while <a href="../mn/mn36.html#content">MN36</a>, <a href="../mn/mn85.html#content">MN85</a>, and <a href="../mn/mn100.html#content">MN100</a> include a long passage detailing his Jain-like fervent austerities. </span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>

<p id="mn26:2.1"><span class="parno">mn26:2.1</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him, “Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Why was the Buddha reluctant to teach? This is puzzling because where we find this trope elsewhere there is a clear reason: at <a href="../an/an7.52.html#content">AN7.52</a> the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to Campā, while at <a href="../sn/sn22.81.html#content">SN22.81</a> he had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. Here, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, there is no such reason. Rather, the events are best understood as narrative foreshadowing. His reluctance requires an intervention by others, and when the teaching finally takes place it is not in a Buddhist monastery but on Brahmanical grounds. The story goes on to tell how, after his awakening, he was reluctant to teach until the intervention of Brahmā (<a href="#mn26:19.1">below</a>). This narrative mirroring creates a hidden link (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sandhi</i>) that frames the awakening in a Brahmanical context. The very obscurity of the connection is the point, for “the gods love hidden things”. The theme of reluctance is extended further to the reluctance of the five mendicants to receive the Buddha. It draws on the precedent of Yājñavalkya’s reluctance to teach Janaka (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1).  </span></span></span> It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” </p>




<p id="mn26:2.5"><span class="parno">mn26:2.5</span>“Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Rammaka appears only here, and the commentary offers no information. His name presumably signifies that he was a follower of the teacher Rāma who appears below. This complements <a href="../an/an3.126.html#p2">AN3.126</a>, where the Buddha stays in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma, who was apparently a student of Āḷāra Kālāma.  </span></span></span> Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn26:2.7"><span class="parno">mn26:2.7</span>“Yes, reverend,” they replied. </p>

<p id="mn26:3.1"><span class="parno">mn26:3.1</span>Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha addressed Ānanda,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The narrative sequence from the Buddha returning from alms round to coming out from his bath is also found at <a href="../an/an6.43.html#content">AN6.43</a>. There, there is a clear justification for the story, as the discourse concerns a royal elephant parade seen after bathing. Here, once more, the purpose is implicit: a brahmanical student must bathe before any ritual.</span></span></span> “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">After the Jetavana, this was the best-known monastery in Sāvatthī. It was offered by the lady Visākhā, known as Migāra’s mother. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:3.3"><span class="parno">mn26:3.3</span>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery for the day’s meditation. In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.” </p>

<p id="mn26:3.7"><span class="parno">mn26:3.7</span>“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn26:3.8"><span class="parno">mn26:3.8</span>So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs. Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby. It’s so delightful, so lovely. Please visit it out of sympathy.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>

<p id="mn26:4.1"><span class="parno">mn26:4.1</span>He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage. Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here (and at <a href="../mn/mn92.html#mn92:3.8">MN92:4.1</a>) a “hermitage” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">assama</i>, “ashram”) is a sizable building suitable for gatherings, whereas at <a href="../sn/sn11.9.html#content">SN11.9</a> it is a gated compound with leaf huts. It is normally used for Brahmanical places. </span></span></span> The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked on the door-panel.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../an/an9.4.html#content">AN9.4</a>.</span></span></span> The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha, and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>

<p id="mn26:4.9"><span class="parno">mn26:4.9</span>“Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.” </p>

<hr>

<a id="searches"></a>
<p id="mn26:4.10"><span class="parno">mn26:4.10</span>“Good, mendicants! It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching. When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Noble silence” is narrowly defined as the second absorption (<a href="../sn/sn21.1.html#content">SN21.1</a>).</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:5.1"><span class="parno">mn26:5.1</span>Mendicants, there are these two quests:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha picks up from the fact that the mendicants were talking about him, but continues in a depersonalized manner. <br>
The substance of this passage is taught more briefly at <a href="../an/an4.255.html#content">AN4.255</a>.</span></span></span> the noble quest and the ignoble quest.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These opposing quests (or “searches”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">pariyesanā</i>) respond to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.22, which we have already noted as a source for the phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">so attā so loko</i> (<a href="../mn/mn22.html#mn22:13.26">MN22:15.1</a>). It says that the wise ones of old, renouncing the search for sons, for wealth, and for the heavenly worlds, lived the mendicant’s life (<i lang="pi" translate="no">putraiṣaṇāyāśca vittaiṣaṇāyāśca lokaiṣaṇāyāśca vyutthāyātha bhikśācaryaṁ caranti</i>). The inner self sought by the brahmins is described as unborn, made of consciousness, undecaying, unattached, and unaffected by karma; knowing it one becomes a sage.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn26:5.3"><span class="parno">mn26:5.3</span>And what is the ignoble quest? It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things. </p>

<p id="mn26:6.1"><span class="parno">mn26:6.1</span>And what should be described as liable to be reborn?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali includes “gold and money” among those things subject to birth, old age, and defilement. The Chinese parallel MA 204 (T i 776a7; cf. T 765 at T xvii 679b23) does not mention “birth” but says money and jewelry are subject to old age, defilement, etc. Elsewhere in the suttas, rebirth, old age, and defilement are qualities of sentient beings, not inanimate objects, so this might be a textual corruption. Nonetheless, the commentary offers explanations for why gold and money are included under these specific categories and not the rest, and this, together with the Chinese text, shows that if it is a corruption it is an old one. I give the commentarial explanations.</span></span></span> Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to be reborn.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gold and money are subject to “birth” because they are produced by heat (<i lang="pi" translate="no">utusamuṭṭhāna</i>). <br>
The word for “gold” here, one of several in Pali, is <i lang="pi" translate="no">jātarūpa</i>, literally “born form”, i.e. that which is naturally beautiful. In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.25, a newborn infant  is to be fed mixed curd, honey, and ghee with a piece of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jātarūpa</i>, thus placing “golden” Vedic speech in him. This rare early instance of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jātarūpa</i> shows that it had a felt connection with the idea of birth. Perhaps this connection prompted its inclusion here. From that, “money” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">rajata</i>) was brought in as the two form a stock phrase, and they were then applied elsewhere in the list. </span></span></span> These attachments are liable to be reborn. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn. </p>

<p id="mn26:7.1"><span class="parno">mn26:7.1</span>And what should be described as liable to grow old? Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to grow old.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gold and money grow old due to rust or grime.</span></span></span> These attachments are liable to grow old. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old. </p>

<p id="mn26:8.1"><span class="parno">mn26:8.1</span>And what should be described as liable to fall sick? Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick. These attachments are liable to fall sick. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to falling sick, seeks what is also liable to fall sick. </p>

<p id="mn26:9.1"><span class="parno">mn26:9.1</span>And what should be described as liable to die? Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to die. These attachments are liable to die. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to die, seeks what is also liable to die. </p>

<p id="mn26:10.1"><span class="parno">mn26:10.1</span>And what should be described as liable to sorrow? Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to sorrow. These attachments are liable to sorrow. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to sorrow, seeks what is also liable to sorrow. </p>

<p id="mn26:11.1"><span class="parno">mn26:11.1</span>And what should be described as liable to corruption? Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and currency are liable to corruption.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Gold and money are liable to corruption by iron, etc.</span></span></span> These attachments are liable to corruption. Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption. This is the ignoble quest. </p>

<p id="mn26:12.1"><span class="parno">mn26:12.1</span>And what is the noble quest? It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, seeks that which is free of rebirth, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek that which is free of old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As pointed out by K.R. Norman in his <em>Mistaken Ideas About Nibbāna</em> (1994), the epithets <i lang="pi" translate="no">ajātaṁ</i> (etc.) don’t mean that Nibbāna is “unborn”, but rather that in Nibbāna there is no rebirth. Likewise, <i lang="pi" translate="no">amata</i> does not mean “immortal” or “deathless” but “freedom from death”.</span></span></span> This is the noble quest. </p>

<hr>
<a id="intent"></a>
<p id="mn26:13.1"><span class="parno">mn26:13.1</span>Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too, being liable to be reborn, sought what is also liable to be reborn. Myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, I sought what is also liable to these things. Then it occurred to me: ‘Why do I, being liable to be reborn, grow old, fall sick, sorrow, die, and become corrupted, seek things that have the same nature? Why don’t I seek that which is free of rebirth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and corruption, the supreme sanctuary from the yoke, extinguishment?’ </p>

<hr>
<a id="Āḷāra_Kālāma"></a>
<p id="mn26:14.1"><span class="parno">mn26:14.1</span>Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This contrasts with the legend that he slipped away in the dead of night.  </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:15.1"><span class="parno">mn26:15.1</span>Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“To discover what is skillful” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kiṅkusalagavesī</i>) might also be translated, “seeking to answer the question, ‘what is good?’.” At this point he did not know the path so he sought an answer from the best teachers of his day. <br>
At <a href="../mn/mn102.html#mn102:24.1">MN102:25.1</a>, the “supreme state of sublime peace” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">santivarapada</i>) is said to be “liberation without grasping” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anupādāvimokkha</i>). <br> Āḷāra Kālāma was a senior teacher in the contemplative and renunciate tradition of the Upaniṣads. His meditative prowess is praised by his student Pukkusa the Mallian at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:4.26.1">DN16:4.26.1</a>, but is seen to be inferior to the Buddha’s. At <a href="../an/an3.126.html#different">AN3.126</a> an apparent former student of Āḷāra advocates that teachers who teach full understanding of different things are nonetheless leading to the same goal. Thus, in line with Upaniṣadic philosophy, Āḷāra saw the apparent diversity of phenomena as partial manifestations of the immanent cosmic divinity. Āḷāra is usually understood to be named after his people, the Kālāmas.

In the Brahmanical initiation, having accepted the student, the brahmin takes him by the hand and says, “Agni is your teacher, I am your teacher” (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.2). This claims both the universal authority of the divine lineage as well as the personal lineage of that teacher. <br> “Their own insight” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sayaṁ abhiññā</i>); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly emphasizes that the benefits of initiation are for “one who knows this” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ya evaṁ veda</i>, 11.5.4.2, etc.). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:15.6"><span class="parno">mn26:15.6</span>I quickly memorized that teaching.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text does not specify the scripture that he learned, but it must have been Brahmanical, for they were the only scriptures known. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 instructs the new student to first learn the Sāvitrī, specifying the version in Gāyatrī metre (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14). The Buddha refers to this as the foremost verse (<a href="../mn/mn92.html#mn92:25.3">MN92:26.1</a>), and he even specifies the Gāyatrī version (<a href="../sn/snp3.4.html#p456">Snp3.4 verse 457</a>). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.7 goes on to encourage the student in daily recitation of the four Vedas and ancillary literature. </span></span></span> As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ñāṇavādañca vadāmi theravādañca</i>). Taken together, the sense is that his personal understanding agreed with tradition. A less literal translation might be, “I spoke with knowledge and authority.” <br>
For <i lang="pi" translate="no">ñāṇavāda</i>, compare such passages as <a href="../sn/snp4.3.html#p781">Snp4.3 verse 781</a>, “as you know, so you speak” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yathā hi jāneyya tathā vadeyya</i>). In the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, knowledge refers to the hidden connections between the Vedas and the world which reveal the divinity immanent in all things. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Thera</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">sthavira</i>) has the senses “steady, strong” (so commentary’s <i lang="pi" translate="no">thirabhāva</i>) as well as “elder”, for which see Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 26.2.5, where Jātūkarṇya, a teacher of old, is called <i lang="pi" translate="no">sthavira</i>. I take it to mean the “lasting doctrine of the ancients”. This is the oldest use of the word <i lang="pi" translate="no">theravāda</i>, long before it was applied to a Buddhist school.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:15.8"><span class="parno">mn26:15.8</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Faith” (or “trust”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">saddhā</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">śraddhā</i>) was regarded as a quality of the “heart” through which one gained remuneration in the form of fees for priestly services (Rig Veda 10.151.4, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.21). It is like the “trust” that one would place in a bank: an investment is made in expectation of a reward. <br>

While one might expect that the brahmins would identify their goal in a positive sense, this is not always the case. A text of the Black Yajurveda, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.3.11, says that beyond the great Soul, beyond the unmanifest, beyond the Person, is nothing: and that is the ultimate goal (<i lang="pi" translate="no">puruśān na paraṃ kiṃcit</i>). See too Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.12.1, which illustrate how divinity is too subtle for normal perception. The teacher, breaking the kernel of a seed, asked the student, ““What do you see there?’ ‘Nothing’” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kimatra paśyasīti, na kiṁcana</i>). Compare the description of this state at <a href="../snp/snp5.15.html#p1112">Snp5.15</a>, “one sees nothing at all” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">natthi kiñcīti passato</i>).

Compare the pre-Buddhist meditation practice of Govinda (<a href="../dn/dn19.html#dn19:42.1">DN19:43.1</a>), Mātaṅga (<a href="../snp/snp1.7.html#p136">Snp1.7 verse 137- </a>), and Maghadeva (<a href="../mn/mn83.html#mn83:20.1">MN83:21.1</a>), which in all cases “leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realm” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmalokūpapattiyā</i>).

<p id="mn26:16.1"><span class="parno">mn26:16.1</span>I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Uddaka’s teachings are cited at <a href="../sn/sn35.103.html#content">SN35.103</a> and <a href="../dn/dn29.html#dn29:16.1">DN29:16.8</a>. In the former, his obscure verse assumes the identity of “this” (the impersonal cosmic divinity) with himself, while the latter is a distorted reference to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.7. Further, <a href="../an/an10.29.html#p20">AN10.29</a> implies that he taught the “ultimate purity of the spirit”. While “spirit” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yakkha</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">yakṣa</i>) is normally a worldly deity, it is identified with the ultimate Brahman at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.4.1 and Kena Upaniṣad 4.1. Uddaka is apparently the “ascetic Rāmaputta” who was revered by the king, criticized by some brahmins, but defended by Todeyya, a leading brahmin of Kosala often mentioned along with Pokkharasāti (<a href="../an/an4.187.html#p3">AN4.187</a>). </span></span></span> ‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In contrast with Āḷāra Kālāma, here the name is omitted.</span></span></span> </p>

Uddaka was thus the (spiritual and/or biological) “son of Rāma”. This detail is preserved reliably in the different versions of the text. It seems that Rāmaputta had not personally attained the meditation he was teaching. This would also explain why, just a little below, he invites the Bodhisatta to lead the community rather than to share leadership like Āḷāra Kālāma (<a href="../mn/mn36.html#mn36:15.24">MN36:15.26</a>). <a href="../sn/sn35.103.html#p4">SN35.103</a> shows that he did, however, make claims to being spiritually attained.  </span></span></span> Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’ </p>

After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁjñā</i>, Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā</i>). This passage seems to have sparked the conversation at <a href="../dn/dn9.html#dn9:6.1">DN9:6.4</a>, where the Buddha goes on to speak of meditative training to refine perception. Notably, there he mentions all the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> and formless attainments <em>except</em> the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, which is beyond the topic of perception under discussion. This meditative state may be related to the state with “no perception” spoken of by Yājñavalkya. However, it is not possible to literally identify such subtle meditative states on such slender evidence. The point is simply that the contemplative brahmins of the Upaniṣadic tradition of Yājñavalkya did indeed describe their highest state in terms of perception. </span></span></span> </p>

This passage confirms that this usage carries over from the Brahmanical tradition, where it is a common term in the same sense. Thus Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.2 speaks of “mother, father, and teacher”, while Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.23.1 enjoins a student to “live with the teacher until death”, and at 4.9.1 ff. we see the journey of a student to their teacher’s house, where he is looked after by the teacher and his wife. The same sense prevails throughout the suttas and Vinaya, so I translate as “tutor” to identify a close personal teacher. </span></span></span> </p>

It lies by a wide river that is dry in summer but abundant in the rains. Today it is named Līlajan and in Pali Nerañjarā, although that name is not mentioned in this passage. Uruvelā, which aptly means “Broadbanks”, was a locality centered around the market town of Senānigama (“Marshalltown”). There was also a sizable hermitage nearby with matted-hair Brahmanical ascetics (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jaṭilā</i>) who ritually bathed in the water (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#p1">Khandhaka 1</a>). After teaching the five monks in Varanasi, the Buddha returned here to teach them, but there is no record of him visiting subsequently. </span></span></span> There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks.

Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhipatya</i>) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1). The root <i lang="pi" translate="no">pati</i> (“lord”) here establishes a linguistic link with <i lang="pi" translate="no">sahampati</i>. Further, in the earliest use of <i lang="pi" translate="no">svayambhū</i> at Rig Veda 10.83.4, the “self-born” deity Manyu “prevails” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sahuriḥ sahāvān</i>) in battle. Thus we can identify Sahampati, the “Lord Who Prevails”, with the highest divinity recognized by Yājñavalkya, who originated as victor in battle, whose physical manifestation is the sun, whose spiritual function is to imbue all creatures with divinity, and who serves as the ultimate source of authority. Meanwhile, the epithet <i lang="pi" translate="no">sayambhū</i> was taken for the Buddha (<a href="../vi/kd11.html#341">Khandhaka 11</a>).</span></span></span> ‘Oh lord! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Having surpassed the greatest of the Brahmanical contemplatives, the Buddha’s achievement is recognized by the chief Brahmanical divinity.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:20.3"><span class="parno">mn26:20.3</span>Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of me. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said, ‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sahampati is the one who recognizes the potential in all beings, since it was he who imbued them with divinity. He did this to ensure dominance, but now his motive has transformed into compassion.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:20.8"><span class="parno">mn26:20.8</span>That’s what the divinity Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>

Fling open the door to freedom from death!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Freedom from death” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">amata</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">amṛta</i>) is yet another Brahmanical term transformed by the Buddha.

<i lang="pi" translate="no">Anaṇa</i> (“debtless”) is a technical term in the Vedic system. According to Manu 6.35–7, a renunciate must first pay off three debts: study of Vedas, begetting a son, and offering of sacrifices. One who goes forth with these debts unpaid is headed for a downfall. The Buddha has indeed paid off all these debts: he studied the Vedas under his former teachers (<a href="#mn26:15.6">above</a>); he has a son Rāhula; and his path is regarded as the highest form of sacrifice (<a href="../dn/dn5.html#dn5:23.9">DN5:24.1</a>). But in Buddhism the concept is reinterpreted as meaning one has let go of all defilements, becoming a “perfected”, literally “worthy” one, after which one can eat almsfood free of debt (<a href="../mn/mn124.html#mn124:37.2">MN124:38.1</a>, <a href="../sn/sn16.11.html#content">SN16.11</a>).</span></span></span> <br/>

<p id="mn26:21.1"><span class="parno">mn26:21.1</span>Then, understanding the Divinity’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings. And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we see the sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">indriya</i> as “spiritual potential”. Originally it was the state of excited energy produced by soma that allowed Indra to manifest his full power and overcome his foes. It implicitly links back to the five spiritual qualities that the Buddha attributed to his teachers, which he later formalized as “faculties”. Here as there, the idea creates a connection between beings, a recognition of shared qualities that, when properly nurtured, can mature into awakening. </span></span></span> It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. In the same way, I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes. </p>

<p id="mn26:21.5"><span class="parno">mn26:21.5</span>Then I replied in verse to the divinity Sahampati: </p>

<p id="mn26:24.1"><span class="parno">mn26:24.1</span>Then I thought, ‘Who should I teach first of all? Who will quickly understand this teaching?’ </p>

<p id="mn26:24.4"><span class="parno">mn26:24.4</span>Then it occurred to me, ‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me.

<p id="mn26:26.1"><span class="parno">mn26:26.1</span>Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Varanasi, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.

He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence. We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe. But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’ Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed. Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet. But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These ways of address are suitable for a senior speaking to a junior (<a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:6.1.2">DN16:6.2.1</a>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn26:27.6"><span class="parno">mn26:27.6</span>But they said to me, ‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
