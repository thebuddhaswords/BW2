<div lang="en">
<p id="mn27:1.1"><span class="parno">mn27:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta urges against drawing rash conclusions, insisting on a cautious and pragmatic approach to the truth. The theme of epistemological caution is further developed in such suttas as <a href="../mn/mn47.html#content">MN47</a>, <a href="../mn/mn60.html#content">MN60</a>, and <a href="../mn/mn99.html#content">MN99</a>. <br>
According to the Sinhalese chronicle Mahāvaṁsa 14.22, this was the first discourse taught by the arahant Mahinda to King Devanampiyatissa, leading to his conversion and the spread of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. This would have been around 250 BCE. </span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>

<p id="mn27:2.1"><span class="parno">mn27:2.1</span>Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A chariot drawn by mares was the preferred vehicle of Jānussoṇi (<a href="../mn/mn99.html#mn99:29.1">MN99:30.1</a>, <a href="../sn/sn45.4.html#content">SN45.4</a>), as well as the brahmin student Ambaṭṭha <a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.6.1">DN3:1.6.1</a>. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.2.1 depicts Jānaśruti’s wealth as including cows, gold, and a chariot drawn by mules.</span></span></span> He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pilotika Vacchāyana is not mentioned elsewhere. His first name means “patch” and may be a reference to his patchwork robe (cp. “Ajita of the hair-blanket”). Vacchāyana is a patronymic, possibly indicating he was of the lineage of Vātsya, a student of Yājñavalkya (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.5.1.62, Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa 2.35.29).  </span></span></span> and said to him,</p>
<hr>

<p> “So, worthy Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” </p>


<p id="mn27:2.5"><span class="parno">mn27:2.5</span>“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.” </p>

<p id="mn27:2.6"><span class="parno">mn27:2.6</span>“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:2.7"><span class="parno">mn27:2.7</span>“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../mn/mn99.html#mn99:30.5">MN99:30.7</a> and <a href="../an/an5.194.html#content">AN5.194</a>. The Buddha speaks of his own lucidity of wisdom at <a href="../mn/mn12.html#mn12:61.1">MN12:62.1</a>. </span></span></span> You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.” </p>

<p id="mn27:2.9"><span class="parno">mn27:2.9</span>“Mister Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with high praise indeed.” </p>

<p id="mn27:2.10"><span class="parno">mn27:2.10</span>“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.” </p>

<p id="mn27:2.12"><span class="parno">mn27:2.12</span>“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:3.1"><span class="parno">mn27:3.1</span>“Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text differentiates “bull elephant” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nāga</i>), “elephant” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">hatthi</i>), and “cow elephant” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">hatthinī</i>). This is essential to the parable, as the tracker is specifically seeking a bull.</span></span></span> There he’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad. He would come to the conclusion,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">niṭṭhaṁ gaccheyya</i> is an exact match for the English idiom “come to a conclusion”.</span></span></span> ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ </p>

<p id="mn27:3.5"><span class="parno">mn27:3.5</span>In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion, ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ </p>

<p id="mn27:4.1"><span class="parno">mn27:4.1</span>What four? Firstly, I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. They hear, ‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’ They formulate a question, thinking, ‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question. If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that; and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’ </p>

<p id="mn27:4.9"><span class="parno">mn27:4.9</span>When they hear that he has come down they approach him. The ascetic Gotama educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk. They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? Invariably, they become his disciples. When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:5.1"><span class="parno">mn27:5.1</span>Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins … some clever householders … they become his disciples. </p>

<p id="mn27:7.1"><span class="parno">mn27:7.1</span>Furthermore, I see some clever ascetics who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. … They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth. And he gives them the going-forth. Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:7.14"><span class="parno">mn27:7.14</span>They say, ‘We were almost lost! We almost perished! For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things. But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’ </p>
<hr>
<p>When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ </p>



<p id="mn27:7.20"><span class="parno">mn27:7.20</span>It’s because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I came to the conclusion, ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’” </p>

<p id="mn27:8.1"><span class="parno">mn27:8.1</span>When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:8.2"><span class="parno">mn27:8.2</span>“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>

<p id="mn27:8.3"><span class="parno">mn27:8.3</span>Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>

<p id="mn27:8.4"><span class="parno">mn27:8.4</span>Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:8.5"><span class="parno">mn27:8.5</span>Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion.” </p>

<p id="mn27:9.1"><span class="parno">mn27:9.1</span>Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with the wanderer Pilotika. </p>

<p id="mn27:9.4"><span class="parno">mn27:9.4</span>When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, “Brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint is not yet completed in detail. As to how it is completed in detail, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:9.8"><span class="parno">mn27:9.8</span>“Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn27:10.1"><span class="parno">mn27:10.1</span>“Suppose a bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood. There they’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood there are dwarf cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage names three kinds of cow elephants unknown elsewhere. From the context they must be of ascending height. The first is the “dwarf” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vāmanikā</i>).</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:10.7"><span class="parno">mn27:10.7</span>They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces high up. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood there are tall lofty cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Kāḷārikā</i> is related to Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">karāla</i>, which may mean “lofty” or “with gaping teeth”. The commentary applies the latter meaning, but surely the former fits the context. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:10.13"><span class="parno">mn27:10.13</span>They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces and tusk-marks high up. A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ Why not? Because in an elephant wood there are tall matriarch cow elephants with big footprints, and this footprint might be one of theirs.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">One of the many Indic names for elephants, especially cows, is <i lang="pi" translate="no">kareṇu</i> (Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇeru</i> by metathesis), which, being from the root <i lang="pi" translate="no">kara</i> (“doer” = “hand”), has the same meaning as the more common <i lang="pi" translate="no">hatthi</i>, namely “handy”. I think the <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇerukā</i> is the “leader of the cows”, i.e. the matriarch.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:10.19"><span class="parno">mn27:10.19</span>They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces, tusk-marks, and broken branches high up. And they see that bull elephant walking, standing, sitting, or lying down at the root of a tree or in the open. Then they’d come to the conclusion, ‘This is that big bull elephant.’ </p>

<p id="mn27:11.1"><span class="parno">mn27:11.1</span>In the same way, brahmin, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the start of the teaching on the Gradual Training, encompassing ethics (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sīla</i>), meditation (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>), and wisdom (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paññā</i>). </span></span></span> He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely complete and pure. </p>

<p id="mn27:12.1"><span class="parno">mn27:12.1</span>A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect, ‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn27:13.1"><span class="parno">mn27:13.1</span>Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. If a monastic murders a human being they are immediately and permanently expelled.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:13.2"><span class="parno">mn27:13.2</span>They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">To steal anything of substantial value is an expulsion offence.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:13.3"><span class="parno">mn27:13.3</span>They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Chastity” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">brahmacariya</i>, literally “divine conduct”. Here it is used in the narrow sense of refraining from sex, but more commonly it has a broader sense of “spiritual life”.  Buddhist monastics are forbidden from any form of sexual activity. To engage in penetrative intercourse is an expulsion offence.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:13.4"><span class="parno">mn27:13.4</span>They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the first of the four kinds of right speech. Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precepts on speech enjoin a positive and constructive use of speech. If a monastic falsely claims states of enlightenment or deep meditation they are expelled.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:13.5"><span class="parno">mn27:13.5</span>They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Harmony” (or “unanimity”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">samagga</i>) does not excuse untrue, bigoted, or otherwise harmful speech. True harmony is only achieved in the presence of the Dhamma.  
</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:13.6"><span class="parno">mn27:13.6</span>They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. </p>

<p id="mn27:13.7"><span class="parno">mn27:13.7</span>They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Attha</i> is a polyvalent term, here taking the senses  “meaningful” and “beneficial”.

<p id="mn27:14.1"><span class="parno">mn27:14.1</span>They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A Buddhist monk has three robes: a lower robe (sabong or sarong), an upper robe, and an outer cloak. <br>
Here begins the series of practices that build on moral fundamentals to lay the groundwork for meditation. The sequence of contentment, mindfulness, and sense restraint sometimes varies (eg. <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:63.1">DN2:64.1</a>). </span></span></span> They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:62.1">DN2:63.1</a>.

<p id="mn27:15.1"><span class="parno">mn27:15.1</span>When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is not that one cannot see things, but that, mindful of its effect, one avoids unnecessary stimulation. <br>
“Covetousness and bitterness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhijjhā domanassā</i>) are the strong forms of desire and aversion caused by lack of restraint.  </span></span></span> When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know an idea with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:65.1">DN2:66.1</a>, their happiness deepens, as they see that not only their actions but also their mind is becoming free of anything unwholesome. </span></span></span> </p>

It has to do with the perception of environmental phenomena and the comprehension of their meaning, which is very close to the sense of the Pali term <i lang="pi" translate="no">sampajañña</i>. <br> These acts describe the daily life of  a mendicant: going into the village for alms, at which time there are many distracting sights.

<p id="mn27:17.1"><span class="parno">mn27:17.1</span>When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Jain Ācārāṅgasūtra 1.8.2 notes many places used by Mahāvīra for meditation, including a charnel ground, an empty hut, and the root of a tree.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:18.1"><span class="parno">mn27:18.1</span>After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For <i lang="pi" translate="no">parimukha</i> (“in their presence”) we find <i lang="pi" translate="no">pratimukha</i> in Sanskrit, which can mean “presence” or the reflection of the face. Late canonical Pali explains <i lang="pi" translate="no">parimukha</i> as “the tip of the nose or the reflection of the face (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mukhanimitta</i>)”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Parimukha</i> in Sanskrit is rare, but it appears in Pāṇini 4.4.29, which the commentary illustrates with the example of a servant “in the presence” of their master (cp. <a href="../sn/sn47.8.html">SN47.8</a>). So it seems the sense is “before the face” or more generally “in the presence”. <br> To “establish mindfulness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā</i>) is literally to “do satipaṭṭhāna”. </span></span></span> Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Covetousness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhijjha</i>) has been curbed by sense restraint, and now is fully abandoned. </span></span></span> Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Likewise ill will (<i lang="pi" translate="no">byāpādapadosa</i>), which was called <i lang="pi" translate="no">domanassa</i> in the formula for sense restraint. </span></span></span> Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Mindfulness and situational awareness” has a prominent role in abandoning dullness. </span></span></span> Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Restlessness hankers for the future and is countered by contentment. Remorse digs up the past and is countered by ethical purity.</span></span></span> Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The meditator set out on their path after gaining faith in the Buddha.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn27:19.1"><span class="parno">mn27:19.1</span>They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The five hindrances remain a pillar of meditation teaching.

This, brahmin, is that which is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first true footprint of the Buddha is jhāna, not skill in debate or conversion, nor even ethical conduct. Compare <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:75.1">DN2:76.1</a>, where jhāna was the first superior fruit of the spiritual life.</span></span></span> But a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Just as the bull elephant tracker does not come to a conclusion until they have found a bull elephant, here the meditator has not confirmed that the Buddha’s teaching leads to the goal that was promised.</span></span></span> ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ </p>

<p id="mn27:20.1"><span class="parno">mn27:20.1</span>Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ … </p>

<p id="mn27:21.1"><span class="parno">mn27:21.1</span>Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ This too is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ … </p>

<p id="mn27:22.1"><span class="parno">mn27:22.1</span>Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

<p id="mn27:23.1"><span class="parno">mn27:23.1</span>When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.

<p id="mn27:24.1"><span class="parno">mn27:24.1</span>When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.

<p id="mn27:25.1"><span class="parno">mn27:25.1</span>When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.

<p>This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’.

<p id="mn27:26.1"><span class="parno">mn27:26.1</span>Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>

<p id="mn27:26.3"><span class="parno">mn27:26.3</span>They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ </p>

<p>This, brahmin, is what is called ‘a footprint of the Realized One’ and also ‘a trace of the Realized One’ and also ‘a mark of the Realized One’. At this point a noble disciple has come to the conclusion,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Faith, reason, evidence, and experience have all played a role in the discovery of truth. But there can be no certainty until the truth has accomplished its ultimate function, freedom from suffering. </span></span></span> ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha.

<p id="mn27:27.1"><span class="parno">mn27:27.1</span>When he had spoken, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the Buddha, “Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the worthy Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
