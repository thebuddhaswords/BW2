 near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>

<p id="mn4:2.1"><span class="parno">mn4:2.1</span>Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">We meet Jānussoṇi many times in the suttas, where he converses with the Buddha on a number of topics, with a special interest in the afterlife. His name appears in Sanskrit as Jānaśruti or Jānaśruteya, which are patronymics of Janaśruti, “famed among the people”, with the element <i lang="pi" translate="no">soṇi</i> coming from the Vedic <i lang="pi" translate="no">ṣvaṇi</i> (“sound”). The Chinese rendering <span lang="lzh">生聞</span> (“Born Famous”, T 125.2.665b18) evidently assumes the same derivation (<i lang="pi" translate="no">jana</i> “people” is from √<i lang="pi" translate="no">jan</i> “born”). The Pali commentary says it is a title awarded the family priest (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>) of Kosala, which would make him one of the most powerful brahmins alive. However, I can find no confirmation of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested. </span></span></span> </p>

<p>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>

<p id="mn4:2.3"><span class="parno">mn4:2.3</span>“Mister Gotama, those gentlemen who, out of faith in you, have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have you to lead the way, help them out, and give them encouragement.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This statement is sometimes translated as a question, but it lacks the usual question markers. Jānussoṇi first says that living in the forest is hard, then introduces the idea that the Buddha is their guide, following which the Buddha tells his life story. This makes for a better flow of ideas.</span></span></span> And those people follow the worthy Gotama’s example.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Picking up from the previous sutta the themes of following the Buddha’s example and of seclusion. <br> In <i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭhānugatiṁ</i>, read <i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭha</i> (“what has been seen”, i.e. “example”), rather than <i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭhi</i> (“view”) per commentary. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:2.5"><span class="parno">mn4:2.5</span>“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin!” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:2.8"><span class="parno">mn4:2.8</span>“But worthy Gotama, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude. The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:2.10"><span class="parno">mn4:2.10</span>“That’s so true, brahmin! Everything you say is true, brahmin! </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:3.1"><span class="parno">mn4:3.1</span>Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the first of several times in the Majjhimanikāya that the Buddha spoke of his meditation before enlightenment (see eg. <a href="../mn/mn19.html#content">MN19</a>, <a href="../mn/mn128.html#content">MN128</a>). In these texts the Buddha takes pains to depict himself as an ordinary person who struggled with the same issues in meditation as anyone else. <br> “Intent on awakening” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">bodhisatta</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">bodhisattva</i>). Such passages as this are apparently the original context for this term. The Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">satta</i> represents a number of different words in Sanskrit, including <i lang="pi" translate="no">sajjita</i> (“intent on, devoted to, fixed upon”), which makes better sense here than <i lang="pi" translate="no">sattva</i> (“being”).</span></span></span> ‘Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in solitude. The forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi.’ </p>

<p id="mn4:4.1"><span class="parno">mn4:4.1</span>Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conduct.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">That is, their guilt will manifest as fear. Throughout this sutta, the Buddha emphasizes that fear is overcome by the proper development of the path, which leads to confidence and strength of mind. This is in implicit contrast to the notion that one overcomes fear by either brute endurance and force of will or by magical spells and charms.</span></span></span> But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body, speech, and mind. My conduct is purified. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body, speech, and mind.’ Seeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Unruffled” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">pallomamāpādiṁ</i>.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:5.1"><span class="parno">mn4:5.1</span>Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their livelihood. But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified livelihood. My livelihood is purified. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified livelihood.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The purification of livelihood for an ascetic is spelled out in detail in <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:55.1">DN2:56.1</a> as part of the Gradual Training of a Buddhist mendicant. The current sutta can, in fact, be read as a variant presentation of the Gradual Training. </span></span></span> Seeing this purity of livelihood in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:8.1"><span class="parno">mn4:8.1</span>Then I thought, ‘There are ascetics and brahmins full of desire for sensual pleasures, with acute lust … I am not full of desire …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:9.1"><span class="parno">mn4:9.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins full of ill will, with malicious intentions … I have a heart full of love …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:10.1"><span class="parno">mn4:10.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins overcome with dullness and drowsiness … I am free of dullness and drowsiness …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:11.1"><span class="parno">mn4:11.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless, with no peace of mind … My mind is peaceful …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:12.1"><span class="parno">mn4:12.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain … I’ve gone beyond doubt …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:13.1"><span class="parno">mn4:13.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who glorify themselves and put others down … I don’t glorify myself and put others down …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:14.1"><span class="parno">mn4:14.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and craven … I don’t get startled …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:15.1"><span class="parno">mn4:15.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity … I have few wishes …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:16.1"><span class="parno">mn4:16.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack energy … I am energetic …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:17.1"><span class="parno">mn4:17.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful and lack situational awareness … I am mindful …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:18.1"><span class="parno">mn4:18.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who lack immersion, with straying minds …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Straying minds” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">vibbhantacittā</i>. The verbal form <i lang="pi" translate="no">vibhamati</i> is used of a monastic who disrobes. </span></span></span> I am accomplished in immersion …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:19.1"><span class="parno">mn4:19.1</span>‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and idiotic who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of the defects of witlessness and stupidity. But I don’t frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest witless and idiotic. I am accomplished in wisdom. I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest accomplished in wisdom.’ Seeing this accomplishment of wisdom in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:20.1"><span class="parno">mn4:20.1</span>Then I thought, ‘There are certain nights that are recognized as specially portentous: the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are the days of <i lang="pi" translate="no">uposatha</i> (“sabbath”) marking the lunar cycle. </span></span></span> On such nights, why don’t I stay in awe-inspiring and hair-raising shrines in parks, forests, and trees? In such lodgings, hopefully I might see that fear and dread.’ Some time later, that’s what I did. </p>

<hr>

<p>As I was staying there a deer came by, or a peacock snapped a twig, or the wind rustled the leaves. Then I thought, ‘Is this that fear and dread coming?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The dual feelings of love for wilderness and fear of her (possibly imagined) dangers echo the hymn to Araṇyānī, the wilderness as goddess, at Rig Veda 10.146.</span></span></span> Then I thought, ‘Why do I always meditate expecting that fear to come? Why don’t I get rid of that fear and dread just as it comes, while remaining just as I am?’ Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was walking. I didn’t stand still or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while walking. Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was standing. I didn’t walk or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while standing. Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was sitting. I didn’t lie down or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while sitting. Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was lying down. I didn’t sit up or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while lying down. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:21.1"><span class="parno">mn4:21.1</span>There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it’s day when in fact it’s night, or perceive that it’s night when in fact it’s day.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha illustrates his claim that the forests can rob the mind of a meditator without <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>. During the development of meditation, perception can change in strange and unsettling ways, making the meditator question the nature of reality. In some cases, over-exertion in meditation can indeed lead to mental breakdown.</span></span></span> This meditation of theirs is delusional, I say. I perceive that it’s night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it’s day when in fact it is day.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This alludes to the oft-repeated phrase “as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day”, which is associated with the meditative perception of light (<a href="../an/an4.41.html#daynight">AN4.41</a>), the development of the bases of psychic power (<a href="../sn/sn51.11.html#content">SN51.11</a>), and the dispelling of drowsiness (<a href="../an/an7.61.html#light">AN7.61:7.2</a>). The point of that phrase is that the mind has been developed until it is full of light regardless of whether it is light or dark outside. Here, the Buddha forestalls the accusation that this is deluded: he knows perfectly well what is day and what is night.</span></span></span> And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:22-26.1"><span class="parno">mn4:22-26.1</span>My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi and unified.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">To this point, the sutta has been focusing on the foundations of meditation from the special perspective of overcoming fear. Now that this has been achieved, it returns to the standard presentation of immersion and then wisdom. Taken together, then, it is the first presentation of the Gradual Training in the Majjhima Nikāya. <br>
“Unified” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ekagga</i>) is explained in the Pali commentaries as “rightly positioned, well placed”, suggesting <i lang="pi" translate="no">agga</i> here is contracted <i lang="pi" translate="no">agāra</i> (“place”). This is supported by the Chinese <span lang="lzh">境</span> here, which means “place”. However, the Sanskrit form <i lang="pi" translate="no">ekāgra</i> suggests, rather, the sense <i lang="pi" translate="no">agra</i> (“peak”).</span></span></span> </p>

<p>Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Jhāna</i> is a state of “elevated consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhicitta</i>), so all the terms have an elevated sense. The plural form indicates that “sensual pleasures” includes sense experience, which the meditator can turn away from since they no longer have any desire for it. The “unskillful qualities” are the five hindrances. The “rapture and bliss born of seclusion” is the happiness of abandoning the hindrances and freedom from sense impingement. “Placing the mind and keeping it connected” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vitakka</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vicāra</i>) uses terms that mean “thought” in coarse consciousness, but which in “elevated consciousness” refer to the subtle function of applying the mind to the meditation. </span></span></span> </p>

<p>As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Each <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> begins as the least refined aspect of the previous <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> ends. This is not consciously directed, but describes the natural process of settling. The meditator is now fully confident and no longer needs to apply their mind: it is simply still and fully unified.</span></span></span> </p>

<p>And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent.</span></span></span> </p>

<p>With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn4:27.1"><span class="parno">mn4:27.1</span>When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The equanimity of the fourth <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> is not dullness and indifference, but a brilliant and radiant awareness. The fourth <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> is the ideal basis for developing higher knowledges, although elsewhere the canon shows that even the first <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> can be a basis for liberating insight. Without <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, however, the eightfold path is incomplete and liberating insight is impossible. </span></span></span> That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Empowered by the fourth <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration.

<p id="mn4:28.1"><span class="parno">mn4:28.1</span>This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and knowledge arose; darkness was banished and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>

<p id="mn4:29.1"><span class="parno">mn4:29.1</span>When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; <em>why</em> rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in <a href="../mn/mn136.html#content">MN136</a>. The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. <br> “Clairvoyance” renders <i lang="pi" translate="no">dibbacakkhu</i> (“celestial eye”), for which see Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.12.5, which says of the self that “the mind is its celestial eye” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mano’sya daivaṁ cakṣuḥ</i>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn4:30.1"><span class="parno">mn4:30.1</span>This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and knowledge arose; darkness was banished and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>

<p id="mn4:31.1"><span class="parno">mn4:31.1</span>When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. Here they are eliminated forever. </span></span></span> I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. As established in <a href="../mn/mn2.html#content">MN2</a>, seeing the four noble truths indicates stream-entry, while the ending of all defilements indicates arahantship.</span></span></span> I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">arahatta</i>). <br> Many translators use “defilement” to render <i lang="pi" translate="no">kilesa</i>, but since <i lang="pi" translate="no">kilesa</i> appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for <i lang="pi" translate="no">āsava</i>. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn4:32.1"><span class="parno">mn4:32.1</span>Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Bhavāsava</i> is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth. </span></span></span> When it was freed, I knew it was freed.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn4:32.3"><span class="parno">mn4:32.3</span>I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a standard declaration of full awakening in the suttas, said both of the Buddha and of any arahant (“perfected one”). Each of the four phrases illustrates a cardinal principle of awakening. (1) Further transmigration through rebirths has come to an end due to the exhaustion (<i lang="pi" translate="no">khīṇa</i>) of that which propels rebirth, namely deeds motivated by craving. (2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path. (4) Extinguishment is final, with no falling back to this or any other state of existence.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn4:33.1"><span class="parno">mn4:33.1</span>This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the final watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and knowledge arose; darkness was banished and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>

<p id="mn4:34.1"><span class="parno">mn4:34.1</span>Brahmin, you might think: ‘Perhaps the ascetic Gotama is not free of greed, hate, and delusion even today, and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ But you should not see it like this.
