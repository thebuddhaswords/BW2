<div lang="en">
<p id="mn23:1.1"><span class="parno">mn23:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Kassapa the Prince” (Kumārakassapa) was ordained at twenty (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#Kumārakassapa">Khandhaka 1</a>). His verses are collected in the Theragāthā (<a href="../tha/tha2.html#p199">Therigatha 2 verses 201-202</a>). His love of elaborate similes and playful similes is shown in the Pāyāsisutta (<a href="../dn/dn23.html#content">DN23</a>), and echoed here in the teachings to him. He was declared the foremost of those with brilliant speech (<a href="../an/an1.209-218.html#p8">AN1.217</a>). <br>
The Dark Forest (<i lang="pi" translate="no">andhavana</i>) was a thick grove south of Sāvatthī often visited by monks and nuns for meditation. However, this is the only discourse where someone is said to be staying there. The commentary says the name means “Blind Man’s Forest”, giving a highly improbable origin story. But compare Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">andhakūpa</i>, “dark well” or “blind well”, a well covered over with a lid or overgrowth; also the name of a hell.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn23:1.4"><span class="parno">mn23:1.4</span>Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, went up to Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The deity offers a series of obscure riddles full of secret meaning, almost like a dream sequence. The deliberate use of obscurity is a hallmark of Brahmanical literature, for “the gods love hidden things” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">parokṣakāmā hi devāḥ</i>, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.6.2.2 and throughout). The sequence is set out as a quest for buried treasure. This theme is implicit in the Vedic myth of Indra freeing the cattle and the sun from the Vala cave, an act that liberates the truth. Sometimes it is made explicit, as when Indra is said to bring up the treasures buried deep (Rig Veda 8.66.4). The Aśvins are also associated with unearthing buried gems (Rig Veda 1.117.5) or gold (Rig Veda 1.117.12), imagery ultimately based in mining for the wealth of minerals underground. </span></span></span> </p>



<hr>

<p id="mn23:2.1"><span class="parno">mn23:2.1</span>“Monk, monk! This termite mound fumes by night and flames by day.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Worship of termite mounds and the deadly snakes they harbor is still common in India today and is probably pre-Vedic. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa acknowledges a ritual significance to the anthill as a creative manifestation of the earth upon which offerings may be laid and whose ants were divine (2.6.2.17, 6.3.3.5, 14.1.2.10). In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.7, Yājñavalkya compares a dead body bereft of soul to the lifeless slough of a snake on an anthill. <br>
While anthills don’t “fume” and “flame”, large termite mounds leverage the temperature differential of day and night to create convection flows that regulate temperature and flush carbon dioxide.</span></span></span> The brahmin said, ‘Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sword is taken up, a symbol whose roots lie in the discovery of metal smelting and the power this grants to the one who wields the sword. But the phrase has a double meaning, for <i lang="pi" translate="no">sattha</i> means both “sword” and “sacred treatise”, while <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhikkhaṇa</i> means both “dig” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhi</i> + <i lang="pi" translate="no">√khaṇ</i>) and “see” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhi</i> + <i lang="pi" translate="no">√ikkh</i>; this sense not in Pali, but cf. Vedic <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhikhyā</i>). Thus, having entered the Dark Wood, the “clever one” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sumedha</i>) is urged to use the wisdom of scripture in order to see. This sense is reinforced by the fact that is the “brahmin” who says this.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn23:2.4"><span class="parno">mn23:2.4</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a sticking point:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Laṅgi</i> occurs only here, and is glossed by the commentary with <i lang="pi" translate="no">paligha</i> (“obstacle”). Such an obscure term must have been selected for a play on words. Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">lagna</i> has the primary sense “to stick, adhere”, while also having a sense of the beginning or coming into contact with something. In modern languages such as Hindi, Marathi, or Kannada it has taken on the sense of “marriage”, and perhaps here we see an anticipation of this. If we are on the right track, the <i lang="pi" translate="no">laṅgi</i> would be the initial challenge for a mendicant seeker, namely their attachment to family. This would explain why it is the first obstacle.</span></span></span> ‘A sticking point, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the sticking point! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.9"><span class="parno">mn23:2.9</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a bullfrog:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The male Indian bullfrog possesses a pair of prominent dark-blue vocal sacs that puff up and down as it croaks, hence the Pali name <i lang="pi" translate="no">uddhumāyika</i> (“puffer”). <br>
Rig Veda 7.10 is addressed to frogs, who lie fallow in the dry but spring to life in the rains, filling the countryside with their amorous croaks, like the brahmin priests reciting their verses and passing them down to students.</span></span></span> ‘A bullfrog, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the bullfrog! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.14"><span class="parno">mn23:2.14</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a forked path:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Rig Veda 10.88.15 speaks of the two paths of gods and mortals (<i lang="pi" translate="no">devānām uta martyānām</i>), later formalized as the path of the forefathers (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pitṛyāna</i>) leading to rebirth and that of the gods (<i lang="pi" translate="no">devayāna</i>) leading to liberation. This corresponds to the twofold choice of the young Siddhattha: to stay at home or to go forth.</span></span></span> ‘A forked path, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the forked path! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.19"><span class="parno">mn23:2.19</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a filter of ash:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Caṅgavāra</i> is a filter through which, according to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja525.html#29.2">Ja 525:29.2</a>, water drips away like the brief days of our lives. The commentaries say that such alkaline (<i lang="pi" translate="no">khāra</i>) filters were used by laundrymen. This refers to the traditional method of creating lye (a soap precursor) for washing, where a barrel is filled with wood ash through which water is passed. No matter how many pots of water are poured in, the commentary adds, it keeps dripping.</span></span></span> ‘A filter of ash, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the filter of ash! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.24"><span class="parno">mn23:2.24</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a tortoise:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 7.5.1, a tortoise was placed on the altar to represent the primordial powers of creation: the sap of life, the sun, the breath, and the act of creation itself. Its lower and upper shells and its body in-between correspond to the three worlds: the earth, the heavens, and the midspace. It therefore connotes the ancient, endless movement of life.</span></span></span> ‘A tortoise, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the tortoise! Dig, clever one, having taken up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.29"><span class="parno">mn23:2.29</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a butcher’s knife and chopping board:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In this brutal simile, <i lang="pi" translate="no">asi</i> is a knife and <i lang="pi" translate="no">sūna</i> is a place where animals are slaughtered, either a slaughterhouse or, as here, an implement for the slaughter.The Questions of King Milinda (Mnd 1:23.18) says this phrase has the meaning of “chopping” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhikuṭṭanaṭṭhena</i>). Compare with <i lang="pi" translate="no">asiṁ sūnāṁ</i> in the violent, sexually graphic hymn at Rig Veda 10.86.18c. Vedic <i lang="pi" translate="no">sūna</i> was a (sewn) “basket” for carrying the flesh of a slaughtered beast (see also Rig Veda 1.161.10), a sense that developed to “chopping block” and “slaughterhouse”. Jamison and Brereton read the Vedic passage as an analogy for the horse sacrifice, at the climax of which the queen has vulgar and very public sex with the dead horse. This cements in the most explicit way possible the oneness of sexual potency with the cycle of life and death.</span></span></span> ‘A butcher’s knife and chopping board, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the butcher’s knife and chopping board! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn23:2.34"><span class="parno">mn23:2.34</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a scrap of meat:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Another simile shared with <a href="../mn/mn22.html#mn22:3.4">MN22:3.5</a>. A <i lang="pi" translate="no">maṁsapesi</i> is small enough to be grabbed by a crow (<a href="../mn/mn54.html#mn54:15.9">MN54:16.1</a>), or to quickly disintegrate on a stove (<a href="../an/an7.74.html#p5">AN7.74</a>), thus is a “scrap of meat” rather than a substantial piece. It emphasizes the meanness and poverty of mortal life, our desires and attachments bound up with this transient “scrap of meat” we call a body. </span></span></span> ‘A scrap of meat, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Throw out the scrap of meat! Dig, clever one, having picked up the sword!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.39"><span class="parno">mn23:2.39</span>Picking up the sword and digging, the clever one saw a cobra:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Nāga</i> here means both a cobra—the literal snake that lives underneath an anthill—and the serpent of mysterious power that is analogous to an arahant, the “spiritual giant”.  </span></span></span> ‘A cobra, sir!’ The brahmin said, ‘Leave the cobra! Do not disturb the cobra! Worship the cobra!’ </p>

<p id="mn23:2.43"><span class="parno">mn23:2.43</span>Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is, of course, a direct slight on the brahmins who prided themselves on finding explanations for the most obscure and puzzling passages.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn23:2.45"><span class="parno">mn23:2.45</span>That is what that deity said before vanishing right there. </p>

<p id="mn23:3.1"><span class="parno">mn23:3.1</span>Then, when the night had passed, Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he asked: </p>

<p id="mn23:3.8"><span class="parno">mn23:3.8</span>“Sir, what is the termite mound? What is the fuming by night and flaming by day? Who is the brahmin, and who the clever one? What are the sword, the digging, the sticking point, the bullfrog, the forked path, the filter of ash, the tortoise, the butcher’s knife and chopping board, and the scrap of meat? And what is the cobra?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn23:4.1"><span class="parno">mn23:4.1</span>“Mendicant, ‘termite mound’ is a term for this body made up of the four principal states, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Just as a termite mound is created by activity driven by eating and excreting, so this body is created from within by food. Also, the body, like a termite mound, is home to countless small creatures. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn23:4.2"><span class="parno">mn23:4.2</span>Thinking and considering all night about what you did during the day—<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Apparently stressing oneself at night over work is not a modern phenomenon.</span></span></span> this is the fuming at night. </p>
