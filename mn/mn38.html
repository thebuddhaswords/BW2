<div lang="en">
<p id="mn38:1.1"><span class="parno">mn38:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:2.1"><span class="parno">mn38:2.1</span>Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The opening of this sutta is similar to <a href="../mn/mn22.html#content">MN22</a>. </span></span></span> “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sāti attributes three teachings to the Buddha. First, that there is a “transmigration” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁsāra</i>) from one life to another. Second, that the primary locus of transmigration is “consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>). And thirdly, that the consciousness that transmigrates remains “this very same” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tadevidaṁ</i>), not another (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anaññaṁ</i>); in other words, it retains its self-same identity through the process of rebirth. The Buddha did in fact teach the first two of these ideas, but not the third, as he will explain below. <br> The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad says that as death approaches, the senses and vital energies withdraw into the heart (<i lang="pi" translate="no">hṛdaya</i>), from the top of which the self departs. That same consciousness proceeds to a new body (4.4.2: <i lang="pi" translate="no">savijñāno bhavati, savijñānamevānvavakrāmati</i>). This core Upaniṣadic chapter on rebirth reflects Sāti’s wording as well as his meaning. Sāti asserts emphatic identity using doubled demonstrative pronouns conjoined with <i lang="pi" translate="no">(e)va</i> (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tadevidaṁ</i>), and identical constructions are found throughout the Bṛhadāraṇyaka chapter: <i lang="pi" translate="no">sa vā ayam</i> (4.4.5), <i lang="pi" translate="no">sa vā eṣa</i> (4.4.22, 4.4.24, 4.4.25); see also <i lang="pi" translate="no">tameva</i> (4.4.17). For <i lang="pi" translate="no">anaññaṁ</i> we find the inverse <i lang="pi" translate="no">anya</i> for the “other” body (4.4.3, 4.4.4). For the Pali verbs <i lang="pi" translate="no">sandhāvati saṁsarati</i> we have instead <i lang="pi" translate="no">avakrāmati</i> (4.4.1, 4.4.2). But the connection with <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁsarati</i> is made in the Brahmanical tradition itself, for it says below, “That self is indeed divinity, made of consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sa vā ayamātmā brahma vijñānamayo</i>; 4.4.5, see too 4.4.22), which the commentator Śaṅkara explains as “the transmigrating self” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁsaratyātmā</i>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn38:3.1"><span class="parno">mn38:3.1</span>Several mendicants heard about this. </p>

<hr>



<p>They went up to Sāti and said to him, “Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?” </p>

<p id="mn38:3.7"><span class="parno">mn38:3.7</span>“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” </p>

<p id="mn38:3.8"><span class="parno">mn38:3.8</span>Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him, “Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">If consciousness is dependent it is changeable and cannot be “that very same”. The Buddha spoke of consciousness as a process of phenomena evolving and flowing, ever changing like a stream. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn38:3.11"><span class="parno">mn38:3.11</span>But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:4.1"><span class="parno">mn38:4.1</span>When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:5.1"><span class="parno">mn38:5.1</span>So the Buddha addressed one of the monks, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that the teacher summons him.” </p>

<p id="mn38:5.4"><span class="parno">mn38:5.4</span>“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him, “Reverend Sāti, the teacher summons you.” </p>

<p id="mn38:5.6"><span class="parno">mn38:5.6</span>“Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:5.9"><span class="parno">mn38:5.9</span>“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” </p>
<a id="whatselfdoes"></a>
<p id="mn38:5.10"><span class="parno">mn38:5.10</span>“Sāti, what is that consciousness?” </p>

<p id="mn38:5.11"><span class="parno">mn38:5.11</span>“Sir, he is the one who speaks, the one who knows, who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../mn/mn2.html#mn2:7.2">MN2:8.1</a>.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:5.12"><span class="parno">mn38:5.12</span>“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way? Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause? But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and brim with much wickedness. This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:6.1"><span class="parno">mn38:6.1</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “What do you think, mendicants? Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../mn/mn22.html#mn22:7.1">MN22:7.1</a>. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn38:6.4"><span class="parno">mn38:6.4</span>“How could that be, sir? No, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>

<p id="mn38:6.7"><span class="parno">mn38:6.7</span>Knowing this, the Buddha said, “Futile man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception. I’ll question the mendicants about this.” </p>

<hr><a id="fuel"></a>

<p id="mn38:7.1"><span class="parno">mn38:7.1</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness?” </p>

<p id="mn38:7.3"><span class="parno">mn38:7.3</span>“No, sir. For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.” </p>

<p id="mn38:7.5"><span class="parno">mn38:7.5</span>“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be. But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and brims with much wickedness. This will be for his lasting harm and suffering. </p>

<p id="mn38:8.1"><span class="parno">mn38:8.1</span>Consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha’s use of duplicated pronouns with <i lang="pi" translate="no">eva</i> here echoes Sāti’s language, but to the opposite effect. Rather than emphasizing the self-sameness of transmigrating consciousness, the Buddha states with equal emphasis the dependence of consciousness on specific conditions, whatever they may be. </span></span></span> Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and ideas is reckoned as mind consciousness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:8.8"><span class="parno">mn38:8.8</span>It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it burns.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A similar argument is made in the context of caste at <a href="../mn/mn93.html#mn93:11.1">MN93:11.4</a>. </span></span></span> A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire. A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire. A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire. A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire. A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire. A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire. </p>

<p id="mn38:8.15"><span class="parno">mn38:8.15</span>In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according to the very same condition dependent upon which it arises. … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn38:9.1"><span class="parno">mn38:9.1</span>Mendicants, do you see that this has come to be?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“This has come to be” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhūtamidaṁ</i>) refers to dependently originated consciousness (implied by the neuter pronoun <i lang="pi" translate="no">idaṁ</i>).

From passages such as <a href="../dn/dn15.html#dn15:20.7">DN15:21.1</a>, we know that conception occurs at the nexus of “consciousness” and “name and form” in dependent origination. Since it starts with this life only, the first two factors, ignorance and choices, are omitted here, but are implicitly covered in the preceding passage. <br> For the “conception” or more literally “descent” of the embryo, the Buddha uses the same term <i lang="pi" translate="no">avakkanti</i> that, as we have noted (<a href="../mn/mn38.html#mn38:1.1">MN38:2.1</a>), was preferred by Yajñavālkya in the same context. </span></span></span> In a case where the mother and father come together, but the mother is not in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is not ready, the embryo is not conceived.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to <a href="../mn/mn93.html#mn93:18.56">MN93:18.59</a> this was a doctrine of the brahmins, and it was evidently adopted in this sutta as a popular theory of conception. I discuss the role of the <i lang="pi" translate="no">gandhabba</i> in my notes there. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Utu</i> (“the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle”) literally means “season”. As the earth needs rain, a womb is dry and infertile until it is moistened by blood, for the fortnight following which it is fertile and “in season”. Thus <i lang="pi" translate="no">utu</i> can be both menstruation, during which sex was taboo for the brahmins, as well as the fertile fortnight that follows, outside of which sex was also taboo (<a href="../snp/snp2.7.html#p289">Snp2.7</a>). Atharvaveda 14.2.37a speaks of parents coming together “in season”. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.6 expresses the same idea by saying the woman should be approached for sex when she has removed her soiled garments (since she may not change clothes while menstruating, 6.4.13).</span></span></span> In a case where the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, but the virile spirit is not ready, the embryo is not conceived. But when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle, and the virile spirit is ready—an embryo is conceived. </p>

<p id="mn38:33.8"><span class="parno">mn38:33.8</span>They refrain from injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music . They refrain from attiring and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. They refrain from high and luxurious beds. They refrain from receiving gold and currency, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They refrain from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. </p>

<p id="mn38:34.1"><span class="parno">mn38:34.1</span>They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. </p>

<p id="mn38:35.1"><span class="parno">mn38:35.1</span>When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.

<p id="mn38:38.1"><span class="parno">mn38:38.1</span>After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence. Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>

<p id="mn38:39.1"><span class="parno">mn38:39.1</span>They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. </p>

<p id="mn38:41.11"><span class="parno">mn38:41.11</span>Mendicants, you should memorize this brief statement on freedom through the ending of craving. But the mendicant Sāti, the fisherman’s son, is caught in a vast net of craving, a tangle of craving.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The mention of the “brief statement” at the end of a long discourse is puzzling. A similar exhortation to “memorize” a “brief” passage is found in only one other passage, where it is in reference to the short summary passage around which the sutta is based (<a href="../mn/mn140.html#mn140:1">MN140:32.1</a>). Compare the preceding sutta, <a href="../mn/mn37.html#content">MN37</a>, which revolves around a short passage for memorization that is fittingly described as “brief” throughout. That “brief” passage opens by saying “nothing is worth insisting on”, advice that is disregarded by Sāti who “insists” on his own view (above at <a href="#mn38:3.8">MN38:3.11</a>). No “brief statement” is mentioned in the Chinese parallel (MA 201 at T i 769c28), which speaks instead of the shaking of the three-thousand-fold world system.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn38:41.12"><span class="parno">mn38:41.12</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>
