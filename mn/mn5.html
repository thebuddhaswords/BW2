<div lang="en">

<p id="mn5:1.1"><span class="parno">mn5:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha does not appear in this sutta, yet he is mentioned by way of respect, indicating that these events took place while he was alive.  </span></span></span> There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn5:1.5"><span class="parno">mn5:1.5</span>“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>

<p id="mn5:2.1"><span class="parno">mn5:2.1</span>“Reverends, these four people are found in the world.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta emphasizes how even small, apparently trivial defects betray a deeper corruption. Rather than hiding them away in shame, they will only be healed when brought to light.</span></span></span> What four? One person with a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Blemish” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">aṅgaṇa</i>) is used literally as a mark or discoloration on the face (<a href="../mn/mn15.html#aṅgaṇa">MN15:8.3</a>), and metaphorically in the sense of a psychological defect. It stems from the root √<i lang="pi" translate="no">añj</i> in the sense of something smeared on the skin such as ointment (<a href="../mn/mn75.html#aṅgaṇa">MN75:23.13</a>) or eyeshadow (<a href="../mn/mn82.html#aṅgaṇa">MN82:25.14</a>).</span></span></span> But another person with a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’ One person without a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’ But another person without a blemish does truly understand: ‘There is no blemish in me.’ In this case, of the two persons with a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse, while the one who does understand is better. And of the two persons without a blemish, the one who doesn’t understand is said to be worse, while the one who does understand is better.” </p>

<p id="mn5:3.1"><span class="parno">mn5:3.1</span>When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him: </p>

<p id="mn5:3.2"><span class="parno">mn5:3.2</span>“What is the cause, Reverend Sāriputta, what is the reason why, of the two persons with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better? And what is the cause, what is the reason why, of the two persons without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better?” </p>

<p id="mn5:4.1"><span class="parno">mn5:4.1</span>“Reverends, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t generate enthusiasm, make an effort, or rouse up energy to give up that blemish.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When Sāriputta and Moggallāna address each other, they use their name together with “reverend” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">āvuso</i>). Here we just have <i lang="pi" translate="no">āvuso</i>. I take it that Moggallāna is asking questions on behalf of the group, and Sāriputta addresses the group.</span></span></span> And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains. And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place. Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get even dirtier and more stained?” </p>

<p id="mn5:4.6"><span class="parno">mn5:4.6</span>“Yes, reverend.” </p>

<p id="mn5:4.7"><span class="parno">mn5:4.7</span>“In the same way, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that … they will die with a corrupted mind. </p>

<p id="mn5:5.1"><span class="parno">mn5:5.1</span>Take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they will generate enthusiasm, make an effort, and rouse up energy to give up that blemish. And they will die without greed, hate, and delusion, unblemished, with an uncorrupted mind. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains. But the owners used it and had it cleaned, and didn’t keep it in a dirty place. Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get cleaner and brighter?” </p>

<p id="mn5:5.6"><span class="parno">mn5:5.6</span>“Yes, reverend.” </p>

<p id="mn5:5.7"><span class="parno">mn5:5.7</span>“In the same way, take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that … they will die with an uncorrupted mind. </p>

<p id="mn5:6.1"><span class="parno">mn5:6.1</span>Take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish but does not understand it. You can expect that they will focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust will infect their mind.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Feature of beauty” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">subhanimitta</i>. In early Pali, <i lang="pi" translate="no">nimitta</i> is used for a feature or quality of the mind that, when focused on, promotes the growth of similar or related qualities. Thus focusing on beauty fosters the desire for that beauty.</span></span></span> And they will die with greed, hate, and delusion, blemished, with a corrupted mind. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright. And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned, but kept it in a dirty place. Over time, wouldn’t that bronze cup get dirtier and more stained?” </p>

<p id="mn5:6.6"><span class="parno">mn5:6.6</span>“Yes, reverend.” </p>

<p id="mn5:6.7"><span class="parno">mn5:6.7</span>“In the same way, take the case of the person who has no blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that … they will die with a corrupted mind. </p>

<p id="mn5:7.1"><span class="parno">mn5:7.1</span>Take the case of the person who doesn’t have a blemish and does understand it. You can expect that they won’t focus on the feature of beauty, and because of that, lust won’t infect their mind. And they will die without greed, hate, and delusion, unblemished, with an uncorrupted mind. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright.

<p id="mn5:8.1"><span class="parno">mn5:8.1</span>This is the cause, this is the reason why, of the two persons with a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better. And this is the cause, this is the reason why, of the two persons without a blemish, one is said to be worse and one better.” </p>

<p id="mn5:9.1"><span class="parno">mn5:9.1</span>“Reverend, the word ‘blemish’ is spoken of.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Following the commentary, I take this question as an interjection by Moggallāna, even though the expected personal name is lacking.  </span></span></span> But what is ‘blemish’ a term for?” </p>

<p id="mn5:9.3"><span class="parno">mn5:9.3</span>“Reverend, ‘blemish’ is a term for the spheres of bad, unskillful wishes. </p>

<p id="mn5:10.1"><span class="parno">mn5:10.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘If I commit an offense, I hope the mendicants don’t find out!’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Vinaya depends on mutual acknowledgement of offences and mutual rehabilitation. It is a system of social morality, not just of individual responsibility.</span></span></span> But it’s possible that the mendicants do find out that that mendicant has committed an offense. Thinking, ‘The mendicants have found out about my offense,’ they get angry and bitter. And that anger and that bitterness are both blemishes. </p>

<p id="mn5:11.1"><span class="parno">mn5:11.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘If I commit an offense, I hope the mendicants accuse me in private, not in the middle of the Saṅgha.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Many Vinaya offences can be cleared by a simple confession to a single fellow monastic. In more serious cases, however, the entire resident Saṅgha must be involved in the rehabilitation process. In such cases, a sense of collective shame is essential to motivate the offender to change their ways.</span></span></span> But it’s possible that the mendicants do accuse that mendicant in the middle of the Saṅgha … </p>

<p id="mn5:12.1"><span class="parno">mn5:12.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘If I commit an offense, I hope I’m accused by a counterpart, not by someone who is not a counterpart.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Counterpart” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paṭipuggala</i>) is elsewhere used of the Buddha, where it is paired with <i lang="pi" translate="no">sama</i> in a negative sense, “without equal or rival” (eg. <a href="../mn/mn56.html#29.54">MN56:29.54</a>). Here, the commentary explains it as someone who is a counterpart in that they too have committed an offense (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sāpattiko</i>, cp. <a href="../vi/kd2.html#">Khandhaka 2</a>), or because they are similar in caste, learning, etc. </span></span></span> But it’s possible that someone who is not a counterpart accuses that mendicant … </p>

<p id="mn5:13.1"><span class="parno">mn5:13.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘Oh, I hope the Teacher will teach the mendicants by repeatedly questioning me alone, not some other mendicant.’ But it’s possible that the Teacher will teach the mendicants by repeatedly questioning some other mendicant … </p>

<p id="mn5:14.1"><span class="parno">mn5:14.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘Oh, I hope the mendicants will enter the village for the meal putting me at the very front, not some other mendicant.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally, mendicants would wander for alms, which was usually done alone or with an attendant. In some places today, such as north-east Thailand, mendicant go for alms in a line. The phrasing “for the meal”, however, seems to refer to an occasion when a group of mendicants have been invited to take the meal in someone’s house.</span></span></span> But it’s possible that the mendicants will enter the village for the meal putting some other mendicant at the very front … </p>

<p id="mn5:15.1"><span class="parno">mn5:15.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘Oh, I hope that I alone get the best seat, the best drink, and the best almsfood in the refectory, not some other mendicant.’ But it’s possible that some other mendicant gets the best seat, the best drink, and the best almsfood in the refectory … </p>

<p id="mn5:16.1"><span class="parno">mn5:16.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘I hope that I alone give the verses of appreciation after eating in the refectory, not some other mendicant.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the <i lang="pi" translate="no">anumodana</i>, which is still recited in Pali today. It was a short teaching on the benefits of giving, emphasizing the positive effects of the donor’s actions. See examples at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:1.311">DN16:1.31.1</a> (the same as) <a href="../ud/ud8.6.html#blessing">Ud 8.6</a>, <a href="../mn/mn92.html#anumodana">MN92:26.1</a> (the same as) <a href="../sn/snp3.7.html#anumodana">Snp3.7</a>, <a href="../sn/sn55.26.html#anumodana">SN55.26</a>, <a href="../an/an5.44.html#anumodana">AN5.44</a>, <a href="../an/an5.48.html#anumodana">AN5.48</a>, <a href="../vi/kd1.html#content">Khandhaka 1</a>.</span></span></span> But it’s possible that some other mendicant gives the verses of appreciation after eating in the refectory … </p>

<p id="mn5:17.1"><span class="parno">mn5:17.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘Oh, I hope that I might teach the Dhamma to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen in the monastery, not some other mendicant.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is an offence for a monk to teach nuns with a worldly motive (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc24.html#content">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 24</a>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn5:18-20.1"><span class="parno">mn5:18-20.1</span>But it’s possible that some other mendicant teaches the Dhamma … </p>

<p id="mn5:21.1"><span class="parno">mn5:21.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘Oh, I hope that the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will honor, respect, revere, and venerate me alone, not some other mendicant.’ </p>

<p id="mn5:22-24.1"><span class="parno">mn5:22-24.1</span>But it’s possible that some other mendicant is honored, respected, revered, and venerated … </p>

<p id="mn5:25.1"><span class="parno">mn5:25.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant might wish: ‘I hope I get the nicest robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, not some other mendicant.’ But it’s possible that some other mendicant gets the nicest robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick … </p>

<p id="mn5:26-27.1"><span class="parno">mn5:26-27.1</span>Thinking, ‘Some other mendicant has got the nicest robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick’, they get angry and bitter. And that anger and that bitterness are both blemishes. </p>

<p id="mn5:28.1"><span class="parno">mn5:28.1</span>‘Blemish’ is a term for these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes. </p>

<p id="mn5:29.1"><span class="parno">mn5:29.1</span>Suppose these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant. Even though they dwell in the wilderness, in remote lodgings, eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, wear rag robes, and wear shabby robes, their spiritual companions don’t honor, respect, revere, and venerate them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are the outward signs of someone living a dedicated ascetic life. These and other practices are called <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhutaṅga</i> (“shaking off”) and may be voluntarily undertaken in order to live more freely without attachments. </span></span></span> Why is that? It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright. The owners were to prepare it with the carcass of a snake, a dog, or a human, cover it with a bronze lid, and parade it through the market-place. When people saw it they’d say: ‘My good man, what is it that you’re carrying like a precious treasure?’ So they’d open up the lid for people to look inside. But as soon as they saw it they were filled with loathing, revulsion, and disgust. Not even those who were hungry wanted to eat it, let alone those who had eaten. </p>

<p id="mn5:29.11"><span class="parno">mn5:29.11</span>In the same way, when these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant … their spiritual companions don’t honor, respect, revere, and venerate them. Why is that? It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable. </p>

<p id="mn5:30.1"><span class="parno">mn5:30.1</span>Suppose these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant. Even though they dwell within a village, accept invitations to a meal, and wear robes offered by householders, their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, and venerate them. Why is that? It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable. Suppose a bronze cup was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright. The owners were to prepare it with boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces, cover it with a bronze lid, and parade it through the market-place. When people saw it they’d say: ‘My good man, what is it that you’re carrying like a precious treasure?’ So they’d open up the lid for people to look inside. And as soon as they saw it they were filled with liking, attraction, and relish. Even those who had eaten wanted to eat it, let alone those who were hungry. </p>

<p id="mn5:30.11"><span class="parno">mn5:30.11</span>In the same way, when these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant … their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, and venerate them. Why is that? It’s because these spheres of bad, unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable.” </p>

<p id="mn5:31.1"><span class="parno">mn5:31.1</span>When he said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, a simile strikes me.” </p>

<p id="mn5:31.3"><span class="parno">mn5:31.3</span>“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta. </p>

<p id="mn5:31.4"><span class="parno">mn5:31.4</span>“Reverend, this one time I was staying right here in Rājagaha, the Mountainfold. Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. Now at that time Samīti of the wainwrights was planing the rim of a chariot wheel.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Samīti is mentioned only here. <br> The rare <i lang="pi" translate="no">yānakāra</i> (“wainwright”) is used here instead of the normal <i lang="pi" translate="no">rathakāra</i> (also at Tha-ap 150:1.1 and Varāhamihira’s Bṛhatsaṁhitā 10.17). </span></span></span> The Ājīvaka ascetic Paṇḍuputta, who was formerly of the wainwrights, was standing by,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The primary Pali account of Ājīvaka beliefs is at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:19.1">DN2:20.1</a>. <br> Paṇḍuputta is mentioned only here, although he shares a name with the five “sons of Paṇḍu”, better known as Pāṇḍava, who fought the Kurukṣetra war in the Mahābhārata.</span></span></span> and this thought came to his mind: ‘Oh, I hope Samīti the wainwright planes out the crooks, bends, and flaws in this rim. Then the rim will be rid of crooks, bends, and flaws, pure, and consolidated in the core.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Pure and consolidated in the core” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">suddhā assa sāre patiṭṭhitā</i>) recurs at <a href="../mn/mn72.html#suddhā">MN72:21.5</a> (of an assembly) and <a href="../an/an3.93.html#suddhā">AN3.93</a> (of a crop). </span></span></span> And Samīti planed out the flaws in the rim just as Paṇḍuputta thought. Then Paṇḍuputta expressed his gladness: ‘He planes like he knows my heart with his heart!’ </p>

<p id="mn5:32.1"><span class="parno">mn5:32.1</span>In the same way, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and idiotic. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../mn/mn107.html#heart">MN107:15.2</a>. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn5:32.2"><span class="parno">mn5:32.2</span>But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky.

They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise and clever. Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say: ‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali Text Society edition treats this sentence as a simple continuation of Moggallāna’s speech. But it reads better as an exclamation by the good monks, as indicated by Mahāsaṅgīti’s close <i lang="pi" translate="no">-ti</i>.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn5:33.1"><span class="parno">mn5:33.1</span>Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. Presented with a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This simile is also found at <a href="../an/an8.51.html#garland">AN8.51</a>. It is the inverse of the simile where a vain young person would try to remove any “blemish” from their face (eg. <a href="../mn/mn15.html#aṅgaṇa">MN15</a>, <a href="../an/an10.51.html#content">AN10.51</a>; with <i lang="pi" translate="no">kaṇika</i> instead of <i lang="pi" translate="no">aṅgaṇa</i> at <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:92.1">DN2:92.1</a>). </span></span></span> In the same way, those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith … say: ‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’” And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Spiritual giant” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāga</i>, which also means a dragon, a bull elephant, or a king cobra. <br>
