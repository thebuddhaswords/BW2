<div lang="en">
<p id="mn25:1.1"><span class="parno">mn25:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn25:1.5"><span class="parno">mn25:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:2.1"><span class="parno">mn25:2.1</span>“Mendicants, a sower does not sow seed for deer thinking,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Sower sows seed” renders the triplicated expression <i lang="pi" translate="no">nevāpiko nivāpaṁ nivapati</i>. The root sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">vap</i> is to “cast down” or “sow” seed; it is also used of offerings for the ancestors in the <i lang="pi" translate="no">śrāddha</i> ceremony. It is tempting to translate this phrase as a “trapper” who lays “bait”. But the aim of the “sower” is simply to grow a crop, and to do this they need to keep the deer out. That is the guile of the story: they appear harmless. <br> For an amicable solution to this problem, see the conclusion to the Rurumigarāja Jātaka (Jataka 482) <br>
<i lang="pi" translate="no">Migajāta</i> (“deer”) might be better translated as “wild animals” here.  </span></span></span> ‘May the deer, enjoying this seed, be long-lived and beautiful. May they live long and prosper!’ A sower sows seed for deer thinking, ‘When these deer encroach on where I sow the seed, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this seed.’ </p>

<p id="mn25:3.1"><span class="parno">mn25:3.1</span>And indeed, the first herd of deer encroached on where the sower sowed the seed and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the sower was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed. And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:4.1"><span class="parno">mn25:4.1</span>So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan, ‘The first herd of deer became indulgent … and failed to get free of the sower’s power. Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’ And that’s just what they did. But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin, and they lost their strength and energy. So they returned to where the sower had sown the seed. Encroaching, they recklessly enjoyed eating it … And that’s how the second herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power. </p>

<p id="mn25:5.1"><span class="parno">mn25:5.1</span>So then a third herd of deer thought up a plan, ‘The first … and second herds of deer … failed to get free of the sower’s power. Why don’t we set up our lair close by where the sower has sown the seed? Then we can encroach and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed.’ And that’s just what they did. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:5.19"><span class="parno">mn25:5.19</span>So the sower and his helpers thought, ‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The repeated <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāma</i> is strongly emphatic. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Parajana</i> sometimes means “stranger” but the commentary here glosses it as <i lang="pi" translate="no">yakkha</i>, and a <i lang="pi" translate="no">yakkha</i> named Parajana makes an appearance in (<a href="../mn/mn31.html#mn31:20.4">MN31:21.1</a>). Presumably it has a sense not dissimilar to <i lang="pi" translate="no">amanussa</i>, “non-human”. Compare the <i lang="pi" translate="no">itarajanā</i> of Atharvaveda Saṁhita 8.10.28a.</span></span></span> For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go. Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Vākarā</i> (variant <i lang="pi" translate="no">vāgurā</i>, which is also the Sanskrit form) is a net or snare, which here is staked out on sticks. The deer would have to leap over it, revealing their position. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Gāha</i> here is from <i lang="pi" translate="no">√gāh</i> (“deep place, hidey-hole”) rather than <i lang="pi" translate="no">√gah</i> (“take”).</span></span></span> And that’s just what they did. And they saw the lair where the third herd of deer went to hide out. And that’s how the third herd failed to get free from the sower’s power. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:6.1"><span class="parno">mn25:6.1</span>So then a fourth herd of deer thought up a plan, ‘The first … second … and third herds of deer … failed to get free of the sower’s power. Why don’t we set up our lair somewhere the sower and his helpers can’t go? Then we can intrude on where the sower has sown the seed and enjoy eating it without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do with us what he wants on account of that seed.’ And that’s just what they did. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:6.31"><span class="parno">mn25:6.31</span>So the sower and his helpers thought, ‘Wow, this fourth herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities! For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go. Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’ And that’s just what they did. But they couldn’t see the lair where the fourth herd of deer went to hide out. So the sower and his helpers thought, ‘If we disturb this fourth herd of deer, they’ll disturb others, who in turn will disturb even more. Then all of the deer will escape this seed we’ve sown. Why don’t we just keep an eye on that fourth herd?’ And that’s just what they did. And that’s how the fourth herd of deer escaped the sower’s power. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:7.1"><span class="parno">mn25:7.1</span>I’ve made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:7.3"><span class="parno">mn25:7.3</span>‘Seed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. </p>

<p id="mn25:7.4"><span class="parno">mn25:7.4</span>‘Sower’ is a term for Māra the Wicked. </p>

<p id="mn25:7.5"><span class="parno">mn25:7.5</span>‘Sower’s helpers’ is a term for Māra’s assembly. </p>

<p id="mn25:7.6"><span class="parno">mn25:7.6</span>‘Deer’ is a term for ascetics and brahmins. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:8.1"><span class="parno">mn25:8.1</span>Now, the first group of ascetics and brahmins encroached on where the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh were sown by Māra and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then Māra was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh. And that’s how the first group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power. This first group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the first herd of deer, I say. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:9.1"><span class="parno">mn25:9.1</span>So then a second group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan, ‘The first group of ascetics and brahmins became indulgent … and failed to get free of Māra’s power. Why don’t we refrain from eating the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Following this the Mahāsaṅgīti edition has a ghost sentence, formed by adding the first part of the subsequent sentence with the second part of the previous. It is absent from the PTS text. </span></span></span> And that’s just what they did. They ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:9.9"><span class="parno">mn25:9.9</span>But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin, and they lost their strength and energy. Because of this, they lost their heart’s release,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Heart’s release” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">cetovimutti</i>) is a term for the meditative absorptions, which are listed below. <br>
While these meditators did indeed escape Māra for a while, from the point of view of the eightfold path, they were neglecting right livelihood. A Buddhist mendicant relies on alms, which not only ensures adequate nutrition, but helps build community and spread the Dhamma. <br> For the dependency of absorption on food, see also the Buddha’s account of his own practice before awakening (<a href="../mn/mn36.html#mn36:32.1">MN36:33.1</a>). </span></span></span> so they went back to where Māra had sown the seed and the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Intruding on that place, they recklessly enjoyed eating them … And that’s how the second group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power. This second group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the second herd of deer, I say. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:10.1"><span class="parno">mn25:10.1</span>So then a third group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan, ‘The first … and second groups of ascetics and brahmins … failed to get free of Māra’s power. Why don’t we set up our lair close by where Māra has sown the seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh? Then we can encroach on it and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then Māra won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh.’ </p>

<p id="mn25:10.17"><span class="parno">mn25:10.17</span>And that’s just what they did. Still, they had such views as these:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This group failed to develop right view. For more on these speculative views, see <a href="../mn/mn63.html#content">MN63</a> and <a href="../mn/mn72.html#content">MN72</a>.  </span></span></span> ‘The cosmos is eternal’ or ‘The cosmos is not eternal’;<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the famous list of ten “undeclared points”, which are found throughout the suttas (eg. <a href="../dn/dn9.html#dn9:24.3">DN9:25.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn63.html#mn63:2.1">MN63:2.2</a>, <a href="../mn/mn72.html#mn72:2.1">MN72:3.1</a>, and the whole of SN44). They seem to have functioned as a kind of checklist by which philosophers could be evaluated and classified. In the Jain Bhagavatisūtra 9.33, Indrabhūti Gautama tests the impostor Jamāli’s bona fides by asking about the eternity of the world and the soul. When Jamāli failed to answer, Mahāvīra stepped in, explaining that both the soul and the world are in one sense eternal since they last forever, but in another sense they are transient since they go through different phases. <br>
The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">loka</i> occurs in a number of senses, but here it refers to the entire “cosmos” of countless worlds. </span></span></span> ‘The cosmos is finite’ or ‘The cosmos is infinite’; ‘The soul and the body are one and the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body another’; or that after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists. And that’s how the third group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power. This third group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the third herd of deer, I say. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:11.1"><span class="parno">mn25:11.1</span>So then a fourth group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan, ‘The first … second … and third groups of ascetics and brahmins … failed to get free of Māra’s power. Why don’t we set up our lair where Māra and his assembly can’t go? Then we can encroach on where Māra has sown the seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh, and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then Māra won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed and those worldly pleasures of the flesh.’ And that’s just what they did. </p>

<hr>

<p>And that’s how the fourth group of ascetics and brahmins got free from Māra’s power. This fourth group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the fourth herd of deer, I say. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn25:12.1"><span class="parno">mn25:12.1</span>And where is it that Māra and his assembly can’t go? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the text shifts from “ascetics and brahmins”—that is, any kind of religious practitioner—to “mendicants”, who were Buddhist alms-gatherers. Having learned the importance of right livelihood and right view, they are now practicing absorption as part of the noble eightfold path.  </span></span></span> This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. </p>

<p id="mn25:13.1"><span class="parno">mn25:13.1</span>Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:14.1"><span class="parno">mn25:14.1</span>Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:15.1"><span class="parno">mn25:15.1</span>Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:16.1"><span class="parno">mn25:16.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:17.1"><span class="parno">mn25:17.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:18.1"><span class="parno">mn25:18.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:19.1"><span class="parno">mn25:19.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra … </p>

<p id="mn25:20.1"><span class="parno">mn25:20.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “cessation of perception and feeling” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saññāvedayitanirodha</i>) is a culminating meditation state of supreme subtlety that often leads directly to awakening (but see <a href="../an/an5.166.html#content">AN5.166</a>). The state itself, like all meditation states, is temporary, but afterwards the defilements can be eliminated forever. This liberating insight is the consequence of the balanced development of all eight factors of the path. </span></span></span> This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.
