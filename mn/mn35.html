<h3>MN35: Cūḷasaccaka Sutta — The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka </h3>

<div id="metaarea">
	<ul class="translator">
		<li>©&nbsp;Translated from the Pali by Bhante Sujato.&nbsp;<a href="../home/copyright.html#sc">(More copyright information)</a>

</div>

<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn35:1.1"><span class="parno">mn35:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>

<p id="mn35:2.1"><span class="parno">mn35:2.1</span>Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker deemed holy by many people.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka is called <i lang="pi" translate="no">nigaṇṭhaputta</i>, being the only person so described. The <i lang="pi" translate="no">nigaṇṭhas</i> (“knotless ones”) were Jain ascetics and their followers were <i lang="pi" translate="no">nigaṇṭhasāvaka</i> (<a href="../sn/sn42.9.html#content">SN42.9</a>). The commentary says he was the son of Jain parents. From the ending of this sutta, where he makes an offering of food, we can see he was not an ascetic, and from <a href="../mn/mn36.html#mn36:48.4">MN36:48.7</a> it is clear he was not a Jain. <br>
This sutta includes a number of images, phrases, and allusions that appear reminiscent of the Brahmanical teacher Uddālaka Āruṇi, although none of the references are definitive. The bulk of Uddālaka’s teachings were to his son Śvetaketu, who became arrogant due to his learning (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.2), paralleling Saccaka’s arrogance. </span></span></span> He was telling a crowd in Vesālī, “I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate. How much more then a human being!” </p>

<p id="mn35:3.1"><span class="parno">mn35:3.1</span>Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Assaji was one the group of five mendicants who received the Buddha’s first discourse (<a href="../vi/kd1.html#p64">Khandhaka 1</a>). Shortly afterwards he inspired Sāriputta with a classic epitome of the teaching. Note that Sāriputta waited politely until almsround was complete before approaching, whereas Saccaka just goes right ahead. We hear of a grave illness Assaji suffered later (<a href="../sn/sn22.88.html#content">SN22.88</a>). <br>
Another Assaji, who is always paired with his friend Punabbasuka, was a lazy and indulgent monk (<a href="../mn/mn70.html#mn70:2.5">MN70:4.1</a>). </span></span></span> As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance. He approached him and exchanged greetings with him. </p>

<p id="mn35:3.4"><span class="parno">mn35:3.4</span>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji, “Worthy Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Sāvake vineti</i> (“guide his disciples”) is typically used by non-Buddhists. <br>
The phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">kathaṁbhāgā</i> (and its counterpart <i lang="pi" translate="no">evaṁbhāgā</i> in the next line) are unique. The literal sense is “with what portion”, and given the answer I think Saccaka is asking for a list of topics.</span></span></span> </p>
<a id="aggivessana"></a>
<p id="mn35:4.2"><span class="parno">mn35:4.2</span>“Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and his instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka is addressed with the Bramanical clan name Aggivessana, probably after the lineage of his clan’s <i lang="pi" translate="no">purohita</i>, just as the Sakyans are called Gotama and the Mallas Vāseṭṭha. A Vajjiputta is referred to as Gotama at <a href="../tha/tha1.html#p118">Theragatha 1 verse 119</a>.</span></span></span> ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The five aggregates are mentioned as if the listener is expected to know them.</span></span></span> Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’ This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Despite this, this teaching that omits “suffering” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dukkha</i>) is not taught by the Buddha at all. It only appears in one other sutta, where it is spoken by the mendicants after the Buddha’s passing (<a href="../sn/sn22.90.html#content">SN22.90</a>; but see <a href="#mn35:9.5"> below</a>). Strikingly, both the current sutta and SN22.90 share a common narrative pattern. In both cases, an interlocuter (Saccaka or Channa, both known for their conceit) asks for teaching from a lesser teacher (Assaji or unnamed mendicants). Their reply omits suffering, but this fails. So they seek a better teacher (the Buddha, Ānanda) who not only includes suffering, but specially emphasizes it (<a href="../mn/mn35.html#mn35:20.20">MN35:21.1</a>). This teaching is successful. This narrative journey mirrors that of Śvetaketu, who studied with others for twelve years before being shown true wisdom by his father Uddālaka. If we are on the right track, the point of the narrative is that it is essential to include suffering. This suggests that the Chinese parallels (SA 110 at T ii 35b4 and EA 37.10 at T ii 715b4), which do include the characteristic of <i lang="pi" translate="no">dukkha</i> here, would be a product of later expansion and normalization. </span></span></span> </p>



<p id="mn35:4.7"><span class="parno">mn35:4.7</span>“It’s sad to hear, worthy Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine. Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet the worthy Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception.” </p>

<p id="mn35:5.1"><span class="parno">mn35:5.1</span>Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall on some business.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Licchavis, whose name is derived from “bear”, dominated the Vajji Federation.</span></span></span> Then Saccaka went up to them and said, “Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama. If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a mendicant named Assaji—I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about! Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about! Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about, and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../an/an6.53.html#content">AN6.53</a> and <a href="../sn/sn22.102.html#p3">SN22.102</a>. </span></span></span> I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing!<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Hemp was beaten and washed in water before being woven into ropes or cloth.  (Also at <a href="../mn/mn56.html#mn56:7.1">MN56:7.6</a>; see <a href="../an/an10.99.html#p2">AN10.99</a> for an elephant’s “ear-washing”.) </span></span></span> Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.” </p>

<p id="mn35:6.1"><span class="parno">mn35:6.1</span>At that, some of the Licchavis said, “How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?” </p>
<a id="cometoseehim"></a>
<p id="mn35:6.3"><span class="parno">mn35:6.3</span>But some of the Licchavis said, “Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddha’s doctrine, when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?” </p>

<p id="mn35:6.5"><span class="parno">mn35:6.5</span>Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. </p>

<p id="mn35:7.1"><span class="parno">mn35:7.1</span>At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air. Then Saccaka went up to them and said, “Good fellows, where is the worthy Gotama at present? For we want to see him.” </p>

<p id="mn35:7.5"><span class="parno">mn35:7.5</span>“Aggivessana, the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.” </p>

<p id="mn35:8.1"><span class="parno">mn35:8.1</span>Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>

<p id="mn35:9.1"><span class="parno">mn35:9.1</span>Then Saccaka said to the Buddha, “I’d like to ask the worthy Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” </p>

<p id="mn35:9.3"><span class="parno">mn35:9.3</span>“Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.” </p>

<p id="mn35:9.4"><span class="parno">mn35:9.4</span>“How does the worthy Gotama guide his disciples? And on what topics does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?” </p>

<p id="mn35:9.5"><span class="parno">mn35:9.5</span>“This is how I guide my disciples, and my instructions to disciples generally proceed on these topics:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">If, as I have argued, Assaji’s presentation is meant to be inadequate, why does the Buddha endorse it here? The Buddha commonly endorses answers given by disciples, and this could have been a product of editorial standardization. After all, it remains the fact that it simply is not true that the Buddha normally teaches in this way.</span></span></span> ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’ This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds.” </p>

<p id="mn35:10.1"><span class="parno">mn35:10.1</span>“A simile strikes me, worthy Gotama.” </p>

<p id="mn35:10.2"><span class="parno">mn35:10.2</span>“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. </p>

<p id="mn35:10.3"><span class="parno">mn35:10.3</span>“All the plants and seeds that achieve growth, increase, and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka argues by naturalistic analogy from singularity to plurality. Likewise Uddālaka, observing the natural world, pointed to the way that multiplicity emerges from singleness. When asked who he worships as self, Uddālaka answers the “earth”, which is said to be the “ground” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pratiṣṭhā</i>, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.17); due to this worship he enjoys food and offspring. However, he points to water rather than earth as the origin of <i lang="pi" translate="no">anna</i>, which is (plant) food but also stands for solidity in general (6.2.4; see too 6.11.1–2). </span></span></span> All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth. </p>

<p id="mn35:10.7"><span class="parno">mn35:10.7</span>In the same way, an individual’s self is form. Grounded on form they brim with merit and wickedness. An individual’s self is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness. Grounded on consciousness they brim with merit and wickedness.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka treats the five aggregates as categories for classifying the self. And indeed elsewhere, such as <a href="../dn/dn1.html#content">DN1</a>, we find various theorists describe the self as “form”, experiencing “feelings”, being “percipient”, etc. In identifying each of the five aggregates as self, Saccaka follows the method of “affirmation” whereby multiple phenomena are affirmed to be the self at deeper and deeper levels, in contrast with the method of “negation” where potential candidates for the self are denied until the final self is revealed. Uddālaka also preferred the method of affirmation, arguing that existence comes first and that the divinity pours itself in all the manifold forms of the world (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2.2 ff.). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn35:11.1"><span class="parno">mn35:11.1</span>“Aggivessana, are you not saying this: ‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’?” </p>

<p id="mn35:11.3"><span class="parno">mn35:11.3</span>“Indeed, worthy Gotama, that is what I am saying. And this big crowd agrees with me!” </p>

<p id="mn35:11.5"><span class="parno">mn35:11.5</span>“What has this big crowd to do with you? Please just unpack your own statement.” </p>

<p id="mn35:11.7"><span class="parno">mn35:11.7</span>“Then, worthy Gotama, what I am saying is this: ‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’.” </p>

<p id="mn35:12.1"><span class="parno">mn35:12.1</span>“Well then, Aggivessana, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, Aggivessana? Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha. Would they have the power in their own realm to execute those who have incurred execution, fine those who have incurred fines, or banish those who have incurred banishment?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali uses the future passive participle, sometimes interpreted as “deserving of execution”. But this would imply that the Buddha endorsed capital punishment, which is unsupported elsewhere and contradicts his ethical principles. Rather, read in its weaker literal sense, “execute those to be executed”, i.e. those who have been found guilty of a crime incurring capital punishment. It is an acknowledgment of the king’s powers, not an endorsement of them. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn35:12.5"><span class="parno">mn35:12.5</span>“An anointed king would have such power, worthy Gotama. Even federations such as the Vajjis and Mallas have such power in their own realm.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka cannily appeals to the Licchavis by asserting their right to rule.</span></span></span> So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu would wield such power, as is their right.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Overstepping the Buddha’s position, Saccaka’s endorsement of capital punishment shows how far he has drifted from the non-violent doctrine of his Jain parents. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn35:13.1"><span class="parno">mn35:13.1</span>“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say, ‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say: ‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../sn/sn22.59.html#p2">SN22.59</a>. This responds to the “inner controller” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">antaryāmin</i>) of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7. Uddālaka learned this from the centaur Kabandha in Madra (near modern Islamabad). He challenges Yājñavalkya, who explains it as the self who lives in the midst of all things, unknown but knowing, controlling all from within.</span></span></span> When he said this, Saccaka kept silent. The Buddha asked the question a second time, but Saccaka still kept silent. So the Buddha said to Saccaka, “Answer now, Aggivessana. Now is not the time for silence. If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The threat of losing one’s head is found at eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.8.6 and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.24, or at 3.9.26 when it actually did fall off. I cannot trace the detail of heads being split in seven to any early Sanskrit texts, but it is found in later texts such as Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.44c and Mahābhārata 14.7.2c.</span></span></span> </p>

There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. </p>

<p id="mn35:22.5"><span class="parno">mn35:22.5</span>In the same way, when pursued, pressed, and grilled by me on your own doctrine, you turn out to be vacuous, hollow, and mistaken. But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī: ‘I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits, were I to take them on in debate—not a leader of an order or a community, or the tutor of a community, and not even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. Even an insentient post would shake and rock and tremble were I to take it on in debate. How much more then a human being!’ But sweat is pouring from your forehead; it’s soaked through your robe and drips on the ground.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The oddly prominent role of sweat in the discourse finds its parallel in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2.3, where Uddālaka argues that existence (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sat</i>) produces fire (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tejas</i>) and fire produces water, which is why you sweat when hot.</span></span></span> While I now have no sweat on my body.” So the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assembly. When this was said, Saccaka sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>

<p id="mn35:23.1"><span class="parno">mn35:23.1</span>Knowing this, the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Buddha,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Dummukha the Licchavi appears only here.

Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.

In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all Saccaka’s twists, ducks, and dodges. Now he can’t get near the Buddha again looking for a debate.” </p>

<p id="mn35:24.1"><span class="parno">mn35:24.1</span>But Saccaka said to him, “Hold on, Dummukha, hold on! I wasn’t talking with you, I was talking with the worthy Gotama. </p>

<p id="mn35:24.3"><span class="parno">mn35:24.3</span>Worthy Gotama, leave aside that statement I made—as did various other ascetics and brahmins—it was, like, just a bit of nonsense.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Saccaka tries to wriggle out of his initial statement, just as modern trolls claim to speak in irony or humor. </span></span></span> How do you define a disciple of the worthy Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions?” </p>

<p id="mn35:24.6"><span class="parno">mn35:24.6</span>“It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the trainee (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sekha</i>). Knowing Saccaka’s attachment to his self theories, the Buddha frames his response with the standard passage on not-self. </span></span></span> They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That’s how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.” </p>

<p id="mn35:25.1"><span class="parno">mn35:25.1</span>“But how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment?” </p>

<a id="unsurpassable"></a>

<p id="mn35:25.2"><span class="parno">mn35:25.2</span>“It’s when a mendicant truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping. They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; solid or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping. That’s how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. </p>

<p id="mn35:26.1"><span class="parno">mn35:26.1</span>A mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualities: unsurpassable seeing, practice, and freedom.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../dn/dn33.html#dn33:1.10.116">DN33:1.10.118</a>, which is doubtless lifted from the current passage. A list of six unsurpassables is found at <a href="../an/an6.30.html#content">AN6.30</a>, but the only common item is “seeing” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dassana</i>), which is defined as seeing the Buddha and his disciples. Here “seeing” is either seeing the Buddha which gives rise to faith, or else “seeing” the four noble truths; practice is the noble eightfold path; and freedom is the result of that path, arahantship. <br> As to why this unique set is chosen here, it is perhaps notable that three of the final similes of Uddālaka’s “subtlest” self (<a href="#mn35:20.7">MN35:20.9 above</a>) in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad speak of <em>seeing</em> (the kernel of a seed, 6.12.1–2), <em>walking</em> (from one village to the next, 6.14.2), and <em>freedom</em> (from punishment, 6.16.2).</span></span></span> They honor, respect, esteem, and venerate only the Realized One: ‘The Blessed One is awakened, tamed, serene, crossed over, and quenched. And he teaches Dhamma for awakening, self-control, serenity, crossing over, and extinguishment.’” </p>






<p id="mn35:27.1"><span class="parno">mn35:27.1</span>When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him, “Worthy Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama. A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama. They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking the worthy Gotama. It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>

<p id="mn35:28.1"><span class="parno">mn35:28.1</span>Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Saccaka addressed those Licchavis, “Listen, gentlemen. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrow’s meal. You may all bring me what you think is suitable.” </p>

<p id="mn35:29.1"><span class="parno">mn35:29.1</span>Then, when the night had passed, those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The idiom “presented with servings of food” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">thālipākaā bhattābhihāraṁ</i>) is elevated, occurring only in the context of aristocracy and sacrifice. </span></span></span> And Saccaka had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own park. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.” </p>

<p id="mn35:30.1"><span class="parno">mn35:30.1</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Saccaka’s park, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Then Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>

<p id="mn35:30.4"><span class="parno">mn35:30.4</span>Then Saccaka said to the Buddha, “Worthy Gotama, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Puññamahī</i> (“flourishing of merit”), for which there are several variants in text and commentary, is found only here and at <a href="../an/an7.53.html#Puññamahī">AN7.53</a>, where it also concerns the dedication of merit to another. It might refer to the glorious results of merit, for which compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.2, “endowed with that (divine fruit for which he wished) he flourishes (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tena sampanno mahīyate</i>). Or else it might invoke the idea that merit flourishes depending on the recipient (<a href="../mn/mn142.html#content">MN142</a>), like a seed on the earth (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahī</i>; cp. <i lang="pi" translate="no">puññakkhetta</i>), which fits nicely with the Buddha’s response here. <br>
Bhikkhu Bodhi’s  remark that Saccaka “must have still considered himself a saint” is unwarranted, as the same phrase at AN7.53 is used by a devoted lay follower. Clearly he was arrogant, but it was others who called him <i lang="pi" translate="no">sādhu</i>.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn35:30.6"><span class="parno">mn35:30.6</span>“Aggivessana, whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourself—who is not free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to the donors.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to one of the Chinese parallels, this statement was made by the Buddha in answer to a question by the mendicants after returning to the monastery (SA 110 at T ii 37b22).</span></span></span> Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myself—who is free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to you.” </p>
