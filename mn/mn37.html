<div lang="en">
<p id="mn37:1.1"><span class="parno">mn37:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery. </p>

<p id="mn37:2.1"><span class="parno">mn37:2.1</span>And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A long account of Sakka’s first meeting with the Buddha and conversion is found at <a href="../dn/dn21.html#content">DN21</a>. There he is said to have attained stream-entry, and so is destined for full awakening. Yet even a stream-enterer may slow their progress by negligence (<a href="../snp/snp2.1.html#p229">Snp2.1</a>) <br>
Sakka’s epithet “lord of gods” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">devānamindo</i>) evokes his more familiar Sanskrit name, Indra. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn37:2.2"><span class="parno">mn37:2.2</span>“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This question directly follows on from the final question at <a href="../dn/dn21.html#dn21:2.6.5">DN21:2.6.9</a>, where Sakka asks <em>whether</em> all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate goal. Here he delves deeper into what that means. <br>
Now that he is a confirmed Buddhist, Sakka switches from “ascetics and brahmins” to “mendicants”. <br>
This passage has an exact parallel at <a href="../an/an7.61.html#p12">AN7.61</a>, and a variation at <a href="../sn/sn35.80html#content">SN35:80</a>.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:3.1"><span class="parno">mn37:3.1</span>“lord of gods, take a mendicant who has heard: ‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha is calling back to the previous conversation, where immediately before asking about the ultimate goal, Sakka had asked why all ascetics did not share a common doctrine (<a href="../dn/dn21.html#dn21:2.6.2">DN21:2.6.5</a>). The Buddha answered that, though the world has many and diverse elements, ascetics tend to fixate on one aspect and “insist” it is the only truth.</span></span></span> When a mendicant has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Completely understanding all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">One who has learned the theory of non-attachment is still liable to become attached, so they apply their knowledge to experiential insight into “all things”. Normally “complete understanding” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pariññā</i>) indicates arahantship, but here it reinforces “direct knowledge” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhiññā</i>) as the wisdom of stream-entry. However, the force of attachment is so deeply ingrained that even a stream-enterer, such as Sakka, with both theoretical and experiential wisdom is still not free. So they must then continue to meditate on the feelings in order to let go fully. </span></span></span> they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings. Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.” </p>

<p id="mn37:4.1"><span class="parno">mn37:4.1</span>Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>

<hr><a id="materialise"></a>

<p id="mn37:5.1"><span class="parno">mn37:5.1</span>Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha. He thought, “Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Moggallāna refers to Sakka as a “spirit” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">yakkha</i>). </span></span></span> Why don’t I find out?” </p>

<p id="mn37:6.1"><span class="parno">mn37:6.1</span>And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the thirty-three.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Moggallāna was the foremost in psychic powers. </span></span></span> </p>

<p>Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a heavenly orchestra.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A <i lang="pi" translate="no">pañcaṅgikatūriya</i> is a band of five musicians, a “quintet”. Here it is amplified a hundredfold, so I translate “orchestra”. <br> “Single lotus” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ekapuṇḍarīka</i>) appears as an auspicious epithet in a prayer for wealth at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.3.6.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>
<a id="kutagara"></a>
<p id="mn37:7.2"><span class="parno">mn37:7.2</span>Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance, he dismissed the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and said, “Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good fellow! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.” Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out, while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side and Mahāmoggallāna said to him, </p>

<hr>

<p>“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Moggallāna refers to Sakka as “Kosiya” rather than the Buddha’s “lord of gods”. Old gods like Sakka tend to accrue many names. The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">kosiya</i> is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has <i lang="pi" translate="no">indra kauśika</i> which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Kuśa</i> grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. Kosiya is said to be a low class family name (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc2.html#lowfamily">Bhikkhu Pacittiya 2</a>). </span></span></span> Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.” </p>

<p id="mn37:8.3"><span class="parno">mn37:8.3</span>“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do, not only for myself, but also for the gods of the thirty-three. Still, what is properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized does not vanish all of a sudden.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary reads <i lang="pi" translate="no">no</i> as a personal pronoun (<i lang="pi" translate="no">amhākaṁ</i>) which results in the sense, “Even what I have well remembered quickly vanishes.” This is logically dubious—how is it “properly learned” if it quickly vanishes?—and contradicted below where Sakka shows that he does in fact remember perfectly well (at <a href="#mn37:12.1">MN37:12.4</a>). Instead, read <i lang="pi" translate="no">no</i> as negative particle. Sakka is brushing Moggallāna off by insisting he has learned his lesson, without taking the trouble to actually remember it. </span></span></span> Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the titans.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">He tries to distract Moggallāna with talk of his glory days, rehashing vendettas that were old even in the Vedas.</span></span></span> In that battle the gods won and the titans lost. When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory. The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers. Each tower has seven hundred chambers. Each chamber has seven nymphs. Each nymph has seven maids. Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?” Mahāmoggallāna consented with silence. </p>



<a id="kosiya"></a>
<p id="mn37:9.1"><span class="parno">mn37:9.1</span>Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also known as Kuvera (<a href="../dn/dn20.html#dn20:9.25">DN20:9.31</a>, <a href="../snp/snp2.14.html#p379">Snp2.14</a>), the name Vessavaṇa means “Son of the Renowned” from his father Viśrava, although <a href="../dn/dn32.html#dn32:7.36">DN32:7.40</a> explains it as from the name of his city. He is one of the four great kings and guards the northern quarter. </span></span></span> When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids, being discreet and prudent, each went to her own bedroom.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The maids are described as possessing the cardinal virtues of <i lang="pi" translate="no">hiri</i> (conscience, discretion) and <i lang="pi" translate="no">otappa</i> (prudence), the “guardians of the world” and the foundations of moral integrity. Former translators have rendered this as if the maids were “embarrassed and ashamed”, but this is unwarranted. The maids were born in this realm as the result of their good kamma in past lives and are simply residing there in their own home. Unlike Sakka, who neglected his lesson and then tried to distract attention when reminded of it, they have nothing to be ashamed of. </span></span></span> They were just like a daughter-in-law who is discreet and prudent when they see their father-in-law. </p>

<p id="mn37:10.3"><span class="parno">mn37:10.3</span>Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a good example of <i lang="pi" translate="no">(anu)-vicāra</i> in the sense of “explore”.</span></span></span> “See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing! And that lovely thing!”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The gods are pointing out various pretty features in the palace.</span></span></span> </p>

<a id="negligent"></a>

<p id="mn37:10.6"><span class="parno">mn37:10.6</span>“That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">After Sakka’s disappointing response, Moggallāna is trying to say something nice. At the same time, he subtly implies the difference between his past merit and present negligence. </span></span></span> Humans, when they see something lovely, also say: ‘It looks beautiful enough for the gods of the thirty-three!’ That looks beautiful for the venerable Kosiya, as befits one who has made merit in the past.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:11.1"><span class="parno">mn37:11.1</span>Then Moggallāna thought, “This spirit lives much too negligently. Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?” </p>

<p id="mn37:11.4"><span class="parno">mn37:11.4</span>Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Referred to at <a href="../tha/tha20.html#p1202">Theragatha 20.1</a>. Moggallāna displayed a similar wonder at <a href="../sn/sn51.14.html#p2">SN51.14</a>, also a means of last resort in the face of negligence. </span></span></span> </p>

<p>Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the gods of the thirty-three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, “Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!” </p>

<p id="mn37:12.1"><span class="parno">mn37:12.1</span>Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him, “Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving? Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.” </p>

<p id="mn37:12.4"><span class="parno">mn37:12.4</span>“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:13.1"><span class="parno">mn37:13.1</span>When I had spoken the Buddha said to me: ‘lord of gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard: “Nothing is worth insisting on” When a mendicant has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings. Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. They understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.” That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’ That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.” </p>

<hr><a id="paricārikā"></a>

<p id="mn37:14.1"><span class="parno">mn37:14.1</span>Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from among the gods of the thirty-three and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery. </p>

<p id="mn37:14.2"><span class="parno">mn37:14.2</span>Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him, “Good fellow, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?” </p>

<p id="mn37:14.4"><span class="parno">mn37:14.4</span>“No, it was not. That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Spiritual companion” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sabrahmacārī</i>) normally refers to a fellow monastic, but here it alludes to the fact that both of them have seen the Dhamma.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:14.6"><span class="parno">mn37:14.6</span>“You’re fortunate, good fellow, so very fortunate, to have a spiritual companion of such power and might! We can’t believe that’s not the Blessed One, your Teacher!” </p>

<p id="mn37:15.1"><span class="parno">mn37:15.1</span>Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, do you recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to a certain well-known and illustrious spirit?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It is unclear why Moggallāna asked for a repetition of the teaching at which he was present. One might have expected that he would report to the Buddha the events at Sakka’s palace.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:15.3"><span class="parno">mn37:15.3</span>“I do, Moggallāna.” And the Buddha retold all that happened when Sakka came to visit him, adding: </p>

<p id="mn37:15.5"><span class="parno">mn37:15.5</span>“That’s how I recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to Sakka, lord of gods.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn37:15.18"><span class="parno">mn37:15.18</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approved what the Buddha said. </p>
