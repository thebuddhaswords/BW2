<h3>MN39: Mahāassapura Sutta — The Longer Discourse at Assapura </h3>

<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn39:1.1"><span class="parno">mn39:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra <em>Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</em>, this is not the same Assapura referred to in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja422.html">Ja 422</a>, as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. <br> Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. </span></span></span> There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn39:1.5"><span class="parno">mn39:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:2.1"><span class="parno">mn39:2.1</span>“Mendicants, people label you as ascetics. And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sutta deals with the difference between outer perception and inner reality, addressing what we call “imposter syndrome”. The Buddha inspires students to aspire to the highest ideal through the practice of the Gradual Training so that they live up to their labels and claims.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn39:2.3"><span class="parno">mn39:2.3</span>Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct. The services of those whose robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick we enjoy shall be very fruitful and beneficial for them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’ </p>

<p id="mn39:3.1"><span class="parno">mn39:3.1</span>And what are the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin? You should train like this: ‘We will have conscience and prudence.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence. This is sufficient; enough has been done. We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic. There is nothing more to do.’ And you might rest content with just that much. I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you: ‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:4.1"><span class="parno">mn39:4.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train like this: ‘Our bodily behavior will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Chiddavā</i> (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (<i lang="pi" translate="no">acchidda</i>) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. <a href="../mn/mn48.html#mn48:6.10">MN48:6.12</a>). <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Saṁvuta</i> (past participle of <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṁvara</i>) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of <i lang="pi" translate="no">ca</i> split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Saṁvara</i> appears in the sense of sense restraint below (<a href="#mn39:8.1">MN39:8.1</a>).</span></span></span> And we won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure bodily behavior.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, and our bodily behavior is pure. This is sufficient …’ I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you: ‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’ </p>


<p id="mn39:5.1"><span class="parno">mn39:5.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train like this: ‘Our verbal behavior … mental behavior … livelihood will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive. And we won’t glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure livelihood.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, and our livelihood is pure. This is sufficient; enough has been done. We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic. There is nothing more to do.’ And you might rest content with just that much. I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you: ‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:8.1"><span class="parno">mn39:8.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will restrain our sense doors. When we see a sight with our eyes, we won’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, we will practice restraint, we will protect the faculty of sight, and we will achieve its restraint. When we hear a sound with our ears … When we smell an odor with our nose … When we taste a flavor with our tongue … When we feel a touch with our body … When we know an idea with our mind, we won’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, we will practice restraint, we will protect the faculty of mind, and we will achieve its restraint.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, and our sense doors are restrained. This is sufficient …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:9.1"><span class="parno">mn39:9.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will not eat too much. We will only eat after reflecting rationally on our food. We will eat not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, we shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and we will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, our sense doors are restrained, and we don’t eat too much. This is sufficient …’ </p>

<p id="mn39:10.1"><span class="parno">mn39:10.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will be dedicated to wakefulness. When practicing walking and sitting meditation by day, we will purify our mind from obstacles. In the first watch of the night, we will continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle watch, we will lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last watch, we will get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying our mind from obstacles.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, our sense doors are restrained, we don’t eat too much, and we are dedicated to wakefulness. This is sufficient …’ </p>

<p id="mn39:11.1"><span class="parno">mn39:11.1</span>What more is there to do? You should train yourselves like this: ‘We will have situational awareness and mindfulness. We will act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’ Now, mendicants, you might think, ‘We have conscience and prudence, our bodily, verbal, and mental behavior is pure, our livelihood is pure, our sense doors are restrained, we don’t eat too much, we are dedicated to wakefulness, and we have mindfulness and situational awareness. This is sufficient …’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:12.1"><span class="parno">mn39:12.1</span>What more is there to do? Take a mendicant who frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. </p>

<p id="mn39:13.1"><span class="parno">mn39:13.1</span>After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence. Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of sympathy for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:14.1"><span class="parno">mn39:14.1</span>Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The similes for the hindrances and jhānas feature also in <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:69.1">DN2:69.1</a> and <a href="../dn/dn10.html#dn10:2.7.1">DN10:2.7.1</a>.  </span></span></span> and his efforts proved successful. He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. Thinking about this, he’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>

<p id="mn39:14.8"><span class="parno">mn39:14.8</span>Suppose a person was sick, suffering, and gravely ill. They’d lose their appetite and get physically weak. But after some time they’d recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>

<p id="mn39:14.13"><span class="parno">mn39:14.13</span>Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. But after some time they were released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>

<p id="mn39:14.18"><span class="parno">mn39:14.18</span>Suppose a person was a bondservant. They would not be their own master, but indentured to another, unable to go where they wish. But after some time they’d be freed from servitude. They would be their own master, not indentured to another, an emancipated individual able to go where they wish. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:14.23"><span class="parno">mn39:14.23</span>Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road. But after some time they crossed over the desert, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:14.29"><span class="parno">mn39:14.29</span>In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and a place of sanctuary at last. </p>

<p id="mn39:15.1"><span class="parno">mn39:15.1</span>They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (<i lang="pi" translate="no">phoṭṭhabba</i>), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (<i lang="pi" translate="no">manomayakāya</i>), to the direct personal realization of highest truth (<a href="../mn/mn70.html#mn70:22.1">MN70:23.1</a>: <i lang="pi" translate="no">kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti</i>).</span></span></span> It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn39:15.5"><span class="parno">mn39:15.5</span>In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:16.1"><span class="parno">mn39:16.1</span>Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn39:16.4"><span class="parno">mn39:16.4</span>In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. </p>

<p id="mn39:17.1"><span class="parno">mn39:17.1</span>Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn39:17.4"><span class="parno">mn39:17.4</span>In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:18.1"><span class="parno">mn39:18.1</span>Furthermore, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn39:18.4"><span class="parno">mn39:18.4</span>In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn39:19.1"><span class="parno">mn39:19.1</span>When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives. They recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details. Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village.

That’s how a mendicant is a brahmin. </p>

<p id="mn39:25.1"><span class="parno">mn39:25.1</span>And how is a mendicant a bathed initiate?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A <i lang="pi" translate="no">nhātaka</i> (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">snātaka</i>) is one who has performed the ritual ablutions on the completion of his studies. </span></span></span> They have bathed off the bad, unskillful qualities.

<p id="mn39:26.1"><span class="parno">mn39:26.1</span>And how is a mendicant a knowledge master?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “knowledge” in <i lang="pi" translate="no">vedagū</i> is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. Curiously, it is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. Perhaps it arose by contraction from <i lang="pi" translate="no">(tiṇṇaṁ) vedānaṁ pāragū</i> (cf. Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">vedapāraga</i>).</span></span></span> They have known the bad, unskillful qualities. That’s how a mendicant is a knowledge master. </p>

<p id="mn39:27.1"><span class="parno">mn39:27.1</span>And how is a mendicant a scholar?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Sottiya</i> (“scholar”) is from the root “to hear”, as is the more familiar Pali term <i lang="pi" translate="no">sāvaka</i> (“disciple”, “student”, literally “hearkener”). In Brahmanism <i lang="pi" translate="no">śrotrīya</i> refers to one who is well versed in the Vedas. Here, however, it is connected with the root <i lang="pi" translate="no">su</i> (“to flow”), as in one who has “rinsed off” or “scoured off” bad things. </span></span></span> They have scoured off the bad, unskillful qualities. That’s how a mendicant is a scholar. </p>

<p id="mn39:28.1"><span class="parno">mn39:28.1</span>And how is a mendicant a noble one?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Both <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> and <i lang="pi" translate="no">arahant</i> are explained with the same word <i lang="pi" translate="no">āraka</i>, meaning “far from (defilements)”. The commentary gives <i lang="pi" translate="no">āraka</i> in both cases, but explains <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> as “slayer” and <i lang="pi" translate="no">arahant</i> as “far from”. At <a href="../an/an7.91.html#content">AN7.91</a>, PTS has <i lang="pi" translate="no">arīhatattā</i>, “foe-slayer” for <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> (BJT omits, while at least one more variant is attested). This is a slightly better pun for <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> than <i lang="pi" translate="no">āraka</i>, although at <a href="../snp/snp3.6.html#">Snp3.6</a> <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> is punned with <i lang="pi" translate="no">ālaya</i> (“clinging”), which is better than both. Where both MA 182 and the parallel to <a href="../mn/mn40.html#content">MN40</a> at MA 183 at T i 726c13 mention the <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i>, the Indic pun underlying EA 49.8 seems to be that a <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṣatriya</i> is so called because they “end” (Sanskit <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṣaya</i>) the defilements. Neither of the Chinese parallels (MA 182 at T i 725c4, EA 49.8 at T ii 802b4) mentions the <i lang="pi" translate="no">arahant</i>, suggesting it was added later, which would explain the duplication of <i lang="pi" translate="no">āraka</i>. However, given that “far from” is consistently attested for the <i lang="pi" translate="no">arahant</i> in all editions and commentary; that “foe-slayer” is attested for <i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i> in some texts and commentaries; and that <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṣatriya</i> in the sense of “warrior” is loosely in the same semantic realm as “foe-slayer”, I translate accordingly.</span></span></span> They have nobbled their foes, the bad, unskillful qualities. That’s how a mendicant is a noble one. </p>

<p id="mn39:29.1"><span class="parno">mn39:29.1</span>And how is a mendicant a perfected one?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Arahant</i> (“perfected one”) has the root sense “worthy” and in Buddhism has the sense of one who has perfectly or “impeccably” removed all defilements.</span></span></span> They are impeccably remote from the bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. That’s how a mendicant is a perfected one.” </p>
