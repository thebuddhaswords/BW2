<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<p>“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

But then they identify with earth, they identify regarding earth, they identify as earth, they identify that ‘earth is mine’, they take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.</p>

But he doesn’t identify with earth, he doesn’t identify regarding earth, he doesn’t identify as earth, he doesn’t identify that ‘earth is mine’, he doesn’t take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because he has understood that relishing is the root of suffering, and that rebirth comes from continued existence; whoever has come to be gets old and dies. That’s why the Realized One — with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all cravings — has awakened to the supreme perfect Awakening, I say.</p>
