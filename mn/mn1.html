<p id="mn:1.1"><span class="parno">mn:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Just as the Dīghanikāya begins with the complex and demanding Brahmajālasutta, the Majjhima opens with one of the most abstruse discourses in the canon. It examines the ways that the process of perception and identification evolves with progress on the path. It was translated, together with its commentary and extensive analysis, by Bhikkhu Bodhi as <em>The Discourse on the Root of Existence</em>. The commentarial background is also found in the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka. The commentary connects this sutta with the Gotamakacetiyasutta (<a href="../an/an3.125.html#content">AN3.125</a>), but there is no internal evidence to support this. </span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ukkaṭṭhā, near Sāvatthī, is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins, likely because it was the home of the prominent Kosalan brahmin Pokkharasāti (<a href="../dn/dn3.html#dn3:1.1.1">DN3:1.2.1</a>, <a href="../dn/dn14.html#dn14:3.28.10">DN14:3.29.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn49.html#Ukkaṭṭhā">MN49:2.1</a>). </span></span></span> There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The pattern of this discourse answers to such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7, where Yājñavalkya expounds a series of principles in relation to which the “immortal self” is conceived. The commentary says that this discourse was delivered to a group of former brahmins who had become conceited when they learned the Buddha’s teaching. While the text certainly responds to ideas and methods of Brahmanical texts, that interpretation is not supported by the text.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn:1.5"><span class="parno">mn:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn1:2.1"><span class="parno">mn1:2.1</span>“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In his third discourse, speaking to Brahmanical ascetics, the Buddha reframed the “all” as the experience of the six senses (<a href="../sn/sn35.28.html#content">SN35.28</a>). The distinctive “conceiving” pattern of this sutta is therefore also applied to the “all” of the six senses (<a href="../sn/sn35.30.html#content">SN35.30</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.90.html#content">SN35.90</a>). More broadly, the same pattern is also applied to the “aggregates, elements, and sense fields” (<a href="../sn/sn35.31.html#content">SN35.31</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.91.html#content">SN35.91</a>). <br> The meaning of “root” is clarified later (<a href="#mn1:171.1">MN1:171.1</a>) as “taking pleasure”, i.e. craving, which is the “root” of suffering. </span></span></span> Listen and apply your minds well, I will speak.” </p>

<p id="mn1:2.3"><span class="parno">mn1</span><span class="parno">mn1:2.3</span>“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn1:3.1"><span class="parno">mn1:3.1</span>“Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">An “unlearned ordinary person”, who has not realized any of the stages of the noble path, is contrasted with one who has entered the path. <br>
“Noble one” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ariya</i>) loosely conveys the sense “cultured” or “civilized”; it is a term for the inheritors of the Aryan culture that originated among the proto-Indo-European peoples of the central Asian steppes. <br>
“True person” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sappurisa</i>) indicates one who is authentic and genuine in their realization of the truth, and hence is virtuous and good. Both “noble one” and “true person” are technical terms referring to any person who has at least entered the path to stream-entry.</span></span></span> They perceive earth as earth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Although their perception (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā</i>) is accurate, to perceive something “as” something is to recognize it filtered through memory and concepts learned in the past, a subtle pre-processing that interprets present experience in light of expectations and desires. <br>
The ending <i lang="pi" translate="no">-to</i> here and throughout is the “ablative of perspective”, which is used with verbs of cognition to express the idea of seeing something in a certain light; for example, one contemplates the body “as impermanent” (<a href="../mn/mn74.html#8.1">MN74:9.1</a>). </span></span></span> Having perceived earth as earth, they conceive it to be earth, they conceive it in earth, they conceive it as earth, they conceive that ‘earth is mine’, they approve earth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">To “conceive” or “imagine” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">maññati</i>) is, according to the commentary, to think in terms of a “self”, proliferating experience through craving, conceit, or views until it is constructed <em>for me</em>. This usage draws upon such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.20, where due to ignorance, a person “imagines” in a dream the fearful things they saw when awake, or at the highest level, “imagines I am this all” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ahamevedaṁ sarvo’smīti manyate</i>). <br> Each of the five phrases takes the “perception of earth as earth” and conceives, imagines, or construes that perception in progressively more differentiated and objectified ways, until it becomes something that is owned and enjoyed.</span></span></span> Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Complete understanding” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">pariññā</i>) is the understanding of the arahant that permanently cuts through all delusions and conceits.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn1:4.1"><span class="parno">mn1:4.1</span>They perceive water as water.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sutta proceeds through the four main physical elements or properties before proceeding to beings and then various deities. The difference between these things is not as clear-cut as one might think. The elements were worshiped as gods, while the gods were often anthropomorphized natural phenomena such as the sky (<i lang="pi" translate="no">deva</i>) or the sun (“streaming radiance”). To identify with a material element is to share the essence of a powerful force of nature. <br> A similar list, but with fewer items, is found starting at <a href="../mn/mn49.html#11.1">MN49:11.1</a>.  </span></span></span> Having perceived water as water, they conceive it to be water … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. </p>

Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. </p>

<p id="mn1:8.1"><span class="parno">mn1:8.1</span>They perceive gods as gods.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Gods” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">deva</i>) or “deities” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">devatā</i>) is a generic description of the many divine entities of ancient Indian belief. Some were inherited from the old Vedic theology, while others reflect local customs and beliefs. All are impermanent and subject to suffering.</span></span></span> Having perceived gods as gods, they conceive them to be gods … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. </p>

<p id="mn1:9.1"><span class="parno">mn1:9.1</span>They perceive the Progenitor as the Progenitor.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Pajāpati (“progenitor”) was the lonely god of creation (“Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us”, Rig Veda 10.85.3). The heat of his fervent exertions (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tapas</i>) created the world and all things in it (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6).</span></span></span> Having perceived the Progenitor as the Progenitor, they conceive him to be the Progenitor … Why is that?

<p id="mn1:10.1"><span class="parno">mn1:10.1</span>They perceive the Divinity as the Divinity.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Brahmā is also regarded as a creator, but in the sense of the underlying divine force that sustains the life of the cosmos. In Buddhism, several individual Brahmās appear, depicted as high deities who achieved their status due to the practice of first <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i> in a past life.</span></span></span> Having perceived the Divinity as the Divinity, they conceive him to be the Divinity … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. </p>

<p id="mn1:11.1"><span class="parno">mn1:11.1</span>They perceive those of streaming radiance as those of streaming radiance.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This and the next two are higher Brahmā realms. Beings in this realm are sometimes called “gods” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">devā</i>). They achieved their status through the second, third, and fourth <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> respectively. Later Brahmanical texts mention a class of Ābhāsvara deities, but it does not appear to be a Vedic concept.</span></span></span> Having perceived those of streaming radiance as those of streaming radiance, they conceive them to be those of streaming radiance … Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. </p>

<p id="mn1:12.1"><span class="parno">mn1:12.1</span>They perceive those of universal beauty as those of universal beauty.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Universal beauty” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">subhakiṇha</i>. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Subha</i> is “beauty, radiance”. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Kiṇha</i> is “universal, entire, total” (= Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">kṛtsna</i>); the same word is the basis for the meditation on “universals” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kasiṇa</i>). The concept appears to be Buddhist, but we find a precedent when Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is “entirely” salty, the Self is an “entire mass of consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13).</span></span></span> But then they conceive them to be those of universal beauty … Why is that?

See eg. the Vedic god Bṛhaspati, identified with the planet Jupiter, or Rig Veda 9.107.15, which describes Soma as <i lang="pi" translate="no">ṛtam bṛhat</i>, “vast and true”.</span></span></span> Having perceived those of abundant fruit as those of abundant fruit, they conceive them to be those of abundant fruit … Why is that?

In Rig Veda 8.97.10 it is an epithet of Indra, but it is not a regular name for a deity in either Buddhism or Brahmanism. Here it appears to be the name of the highest of the Brahmā gods.</span></span></span> Having perceived the Vanquisher as the Vanquisher, they conceive him to be the Vanquisher … Why is that?

<p id="mn1:15.1"><span class="parno">mn1:15.1</span>They perceive the dimension of infinite space as the dimension of infinite space.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here begins the series of realms associated with the practice of formless meditations. These were practiced by the most advanced non-dualist Brahmanical teachers before the Buddha, who identified such experiences with the highest Self that is the cosmic divinity.

The similar sequence at <a href="../mn/mn49.html#the_all">MN49:23.1</a> culminates with “all”. Three interpretations: (1) <em>Simple textual error</em>. Of the three Chinese parallels, EA 44.6 mentions <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i> here, while MA 106 and T 56 do not. If two separate texts have the same error, it predates the separation between the schools, or arose later through contamination. (2) <em>The five kinds of “extinguishment in the present life”</em>. These are false liberations believed by sectarians (Brahmajālasutta, <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn:3.19.1">DN1:3.19.1</a>). The commentary says they are meant here, but it seems unlikely, given that below the stream-enterer is enjoined to not identify with <i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i>, whereas they have already dispelled such misconceptions of the path. (3) <em>An unenlightened person’s misconception of the Buddhist goal</em>. At least some ancient Buddhists read it this way, as this passage is quoted in an Abhidhamma discussion as to whether the deathless as an object of thought can be a fetter (Kathāvatthu 9.2). The Theravāda commentary, rejecting this, says it was the view of the Pubbaseliyas, a branch of the Mahāsaṅghikas.</span></span></span> Having perceived extinguishment as extinguishment, they conceive it to be extinguishment, they conceive it in extinguishment, they conceive it as extinguishment, they conceive that ‘extinguishment is mine’, they approve extinguishment.

<p id="mn1:194.8"><span class="parno">mn1:194.8</span>That is what the Buddha said. But the mendicants did not approve what the Buddha said.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">That they “did not approve” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">na abhinanduṁ</i>) is confirmed in the commentary and in the parallel at EA 44.6, which explains that the mendicants did not understand the discourse. Alternatively, some modern interpreters (Bodhi, Ñāṇananda), relying on the commentarial background explanation, suggest that the problem was that they understood it all too well and were not happy that their beliefs were challenged. These explanations, however, do not take into account the centrality of “approval” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nanda</i>)—it is literally the “root” that lends the discourse its title. Given that an arahant does not “approve” even Nibbāna, and that “approval” is the root of suffering, is it any wonder that the audience did not “approve” the teaching? It is not that they did not understand, nor that their understanding threatened their egos, but that they understood so well that they received the teaching with perfect equanimity. Elsewhere the Buddha urged that one should “neither approve (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhinandati</i>) nor dismiss” a teaching (<a href="../an/an4.180.html#content">AN4.180</a> = <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:4.8.4">DN16:4.8.4</a>, <a href="../dn/dn29.html#dn29:18.4">DN29:18.4</a>, <a href="../mn/mn112.html#3.1">MN112:3.1</a>). It seems that the normal response, where the audience approves a teaching with pleasure, is meant in a conventional sense, whereas this sutta shows how for an arahant all such responses are transcended.</span></span></span> </p>
