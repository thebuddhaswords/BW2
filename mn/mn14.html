<div lang="en">

<p id="mn14:1.1"><span class="parno">mn14:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>

<p id="mn14:2.1"><span class="parno">mn14:2.1</span>Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mahānāma was the brother of Anuruddha and Ānanda (<a href="../vi/kd17.html#content">Khandhaka 17</a>) which, according to the commentary, makes the Buddha his cousin. He remained in the lay life as a devoted and generous follower, keenly interested in developing his practice. The early texts do not record any occasion of his awakening. However, the commentarial claim that he was a once-returner is supported by passages such as <a href="../sn/sn55.22.html#2.3">SN55.22:2.3</a> and <a href="../sn/sn55.21.html#content">SN55.21</a> that suggest he was indeed a noble disciple.</span></span></span> “For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this: ‘Greed, hate, and delusion are corruptions of the mind.’ Despite understanding this, sometimes my mind is occupied by thoughts of greed, hate, and delusion. I wonder what qualities remain in me that I have such thoughts?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As in the opening of the previous discourse, he exhibits curiosity and openness to inquiry.  </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:3.1"><span class="parno">mn14:3.1</span>“Mahānāma, there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughts. For if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures. But because you haven’t given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:4.1"><span class="parno">mn14:4.1</span>Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. So, Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom, as long as they do not achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities” includes the first and second <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i>. The text is in present tense: they <em>do not attain</em> <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>, not <em>they have never attained</em> <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. In order to realize the noble truths, Mahānāma must, of course, have practiced the noble eightfold path, which includes <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. Indeed, at <a href="../an/an3.73.html#content">AN3.73</a> Mahānāma said he understood that in the Buddha’s teaching, “Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.” However, a stream-enterer and a once-returner have not fully given up the underlying attachment to sensual pleasures, so unless they are dedicated to regular meditation following that realization, it is possible for their mental clarity to deteriorate and sensual desires to return. It seems that the temptations and business of the lay life had distracted Mahānāma from his meditation.</span></span></span> they can return to sensual pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali is expressed in a double negative: “they are not one who does not return”.  </span></span></span> But when they do achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that, they do not return to sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:5.1"><span class="parno">mn14:5.1</span>Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right wisdom that: ‘Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’ But so long as I didn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that, I didn’t announce that I would not return to sensual pleasures. But when I did achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that, I announced that I would not return to sensual pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrasing of this passage echoes that of the first sermon (<a href="../sn/sn56.11.html#content">SN56.11</a>).  </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn14:6.1"><span class="parno">mn14:6.1</span>And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures? There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation: this is the gratification of sensual pleasures. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:7.1"><span class="parno">mn14:7.1</span>And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures? It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. But they must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:8.1"><span class="parno">mn14:8.1</span>That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money. If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying: ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’ This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:9.1"><span class="parno">mn14:9.1</span>That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and accrue money. But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it, thinking: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion: ‘What once was mine is gone.’ This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:10.1"><span class="parno">mn14:10.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:11.1"><span class="parno">mn14:11.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There they are struck with arrows and spears, and their heads are chopped off, resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:12.1"><span class="parno">mn14:12.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed by a superior force, and their heads are chopped off, resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:13.1"><span class="parno">mn14:13.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. These result in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:14.1"><span class="parno">mn14:14.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures, they conduct themselves badly by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn14:15.1"><span class="parno">mn14:15.1</span>Mahānāma, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Now at that time several Jain ascetics on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they felt painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">A large open area where the Buddha taught occasionally (<a href="../sn/sn8.10.html#content">SN8.10</a>), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika (<a href="../sn/sn4.23.html#content">SN4.23</a>) and Vakkali took their lives (<a href="../sn/sn22.87.html#content">SN22.87</a>). <br>
The practice of constant standing was formerly undertaken by the Bodhisatta (<a href="../mn/mn12.html#n45:45.6">MN12:45.7</a>).</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn14:16.1"><span class="parno">mn14:16.1</span>Then in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jain ascetics. I said to them,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha reports a similar, but more detailed, conversation with Jains at <a href="../mn/mn101.html#content">MN101</a>. </span></span></span> ‘Reverends, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Even with his own extensive experience in such practices, the Buddha still asks.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:17.1"><span class="parno">mn14:17.1</span>When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me, ‘Reverend, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Jain leader Mahāvīra Vardhamāna is known as Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in Pali texts. He is regarded as the 24th supreme leader of the Jains, although only he and his predecessor Pārśvanātha (not mentioned in the Pali) are historical. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Nigaṇṭha</i> means “knotless” (i.e. without attachments); it is a term for a Jain ascetic. Nātaputta indicates his clan the Ñātikas (Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">jñātiputra</i>; Prākrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāyaputta</i>). The Pali tradition has confused <i lang="pi" translate="no">ñāti</i> (“family”) with <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāṭa</i> (“dancer”). Thus Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta means “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan”.</span></span></span> “Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha denied possessing such omniscience; rather, he knows the three knowledges (<a href="../mn/mn71.html#omniscience">MN71:5.5</a>). Nonetheless, he can be poetically considered as “all-knowing” (<a href="../tha/tha2.html#p130">Theragatha 2.6</a>, <a href="../tha/tha16.1.html#p721">Thag 16</a> since he understands the “all” that is the six senses (<a href="../sn/sn35.28.html#content">SN35.28</a>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn14:17.4"><span class="parno">mn14:17.4</span>He says, “O Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha emphasized understanding <i lang="pi" translate="no">kamma</i> and relinquishing the causes of new <i lang="pi" translate="no">kamma</i>, rather than wearing away the unknowable mass of past <i lang="pi" translate="no">kamma</i>. <br> Mahāvīra’s emphasis on <em>bad</em> karma of the past presages the modern usage where karma is evoked when something inescapably bad happens.</span></span></span> And when in the present you are restrained in body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future. So, due to eliminating past deeds by fervent mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future. With no future consequence, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The past participle with future tense (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nijjiṇṇaṁ bhavissati</i>) indicates a future perfect sense, “will have been worn away”. </span></span></span> We endorse and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:18.1"><span class="parno">mn14:18.1</span>When they said this, I said to them, ‘But reverends, do you know for sure that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you did not exist?’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.4"><span class="parno">mn14:18.4</span>‘No we don’t, reverend.’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.5"><span class="parno">mn14:18.5</span>‘But reverends, do you know for sure that you did bad deeds in the past?’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.8"><span class="parno">mn14:18.8</span>‘But reverends, do you know that you did such and such bad deeds?’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.10"><span class="parno">mn14:18.10</span>‘No we don’t, reverend.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:18.11"><span class="parno">mn14:18.11</span>‘But reverends, do you know that so much suffering has already been worn away? Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away? Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away?’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.13"><span class="parno">mn14:18.13</span>‘No we don’t, reverend.’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.14"><span class="parno">mn14:18.14</span>‘But reverends, do you know about giving up unskillful qualities in this very life and embracing skillful qualities?’ </p>

<p id="mn14:18.16"><span class="parno">mn14:18.16</span>‘No we don’t, reverend.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn14:19.1"><span class="parno">mn14:19.1</span>‘So it seems that you don’t know any of these things. That being so, when those in the world who are violent and bloody-handed and of cruel livelihood are reborn among humans they go forth as Jain ascetics.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This point is argued in more detail at <a href="../mn/mn101.html#content">MN101</a> ff. <br> “Cruel livelihood” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kurūrakammantā</i>) is defined at <a href="../mn/mn51.html#kurūrakammantā">MN51:9.2</a>, etc. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>
