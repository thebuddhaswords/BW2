<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn12:1.1"><span class="parno">mn12:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying outside the city of Vesālī in a woodland grove west of the town.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This description of the Buddha’s location is unique. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn12:2.1"><span class="parno">mn12:2.1</span>Now at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and training.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sunakkhatta’s dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha in <a href="../mn/mn105.html#content">MN105</a>. In <a href="../dn/dn6.html#dn6:4.9">DN6:5.3</a> we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. The current sutta and <a href="../dn/dn24.html#content">DN24</a> deal with Sunakkhatta’s bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal.</span></span></span> He was telling a crowd in Vesālī: </p>

<p id="mn12:2.3"><span class="parno">mn12:2.3</span>“The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These distinctions are defined in the Vinaya as “absorption, release, immersion, attainment, knowledge and vision, development of the path, realization of the fruits, giving up the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in an empty dwelling” (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj4.html#quality">Bhikkhu Pārājika 4</a>). They may be summarized as absorption, psychic abilities, and realization of the paths and fruits. </span></span></span> He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha taught that logic alone is an unreliable guide to the truth (<a href="../mn/mn76.html#logic">MN76</a>, <a href="../dn/dn1.html#logic2">DN1:1.34.2</a>), a fact of which Sunakkhatta was apparently not aware.</span></span></span> And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Chinese parallel at T 757, rather, raises the question, “How could such a teaching lead to freedom from suffering?”</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:3.1"><span class="parno">mn12:3.1</span>Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:3.6"><span class="parno">mn12:3.6</span>Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:4.1"><span class="parno">mn12:4.1</span>“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that futile man, is angry.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Futile man” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">moghapurisa</i>) refers to someone who has been led astray by delusion. </span></span></span> His words are spoken out of anger. Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, in fact he just praises him. For it is praise of the Realized One to say: ‘His teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.’ </p>

<p id="mn12:5.1"><span class="parno">mn12:5.1</span>But there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Inference from the teaching” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhammanvaya</i>) is a valid form of knowledge, where someone draws a reasoned conclusion based on fundamental principles (see <a href="../sn/sn12.33.html#content">SN12.33</a>). </span></span></span> ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ </p>

<p id="mn12:6.1"><span class="parno">mn12:6.1</span>And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching: ‘That Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Buddha introduces these here because, as we know from <a href="../dn/dn24.html#dn24:1.3.11">DN24:1.4.1</a>, Sunakkhatta thought that such displays were a worthy goal of spiritual practice. The Chinese parallel, however, omits the psychic powers and instead has the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i>. <br> This passage begins the six direct knowledges.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:7.1"><span class="parno">mn12:7.1</span>And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching: ‘That Blessed One, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hears both kinds of sounds, human and heavenly, whether near or far.’ </p>
<a id="10powers"></a>
<p id="mn12:8.1"><span class="parno">mn12:8.1</span>And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching: ‘That Blessed One understands the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with his own mind. He understands mind with greed as “mind with greed,” and mind without greed as “mind without greed.” He understands mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is supreme … mind that is not supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind as “freed mind,” and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind.”’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:9.1"><span class="parno">mn12:9.1</span>There are these ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">After the first three of the direct knowledges, the sequence is interrupted with the insertion of these ten powers of a Realized One, also found at <a href="../an/an10.21.html#content">AN10.21</a> and <a href="../an/an10.22.html#content">AN10.22</a>. The Vibhaṅga, an early Abhidhamma book, gives a detailed explanation. <br>
Five powers are listed at <a href="../an/an5.11.html#content">AN5.11</a> and six at <a href="../an/an6.64.html#content">AN6.64</a>. </span></span></span> What ten? </p>

<p id="mn12:10.1"><span class="parno">mn12:10.1</span>Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible, and the impossible as impossible.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Explained in detail at <a href="../mn/mn115.html#skilled">MN115:12.1</a>–17. </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>

<p id="mn12:11.1"><span class="parno">mn12:11.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Vibhaṅga explains this as knowing the circumstances that prevent or support the fruition of deeds, namely: place of rebirth (<i lang="pi" translate="no">gati</i>), form of reincarnation (<i lang="pi" translate="no">upadhi</i>, explained by the commentary as <i lang="pi" translate="no">attabhāva</i>), time (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kāla</i>), and effort (<i lang="pi" translate="no">payoga</i>). <br> See also the analysis of “deeds” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kamma</i>) in <a href="../mn/mn57.html#content">MN57</a>, <a href="../mn/mn135.html#content">MN135</a>, and <a href="../mn/mn136.html#content">MN136</a>. </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:12.1"><span class="parno">mn12:12.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Expanded below in <a href="#mn12:35.1">MN12:35.1</a>–42.13 below</a>.</span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>



<hr>

<p id="mn12:13.1"><span class="parno">mn12:13.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <a href="../mn/mn115.html#content">MN115</a>.</span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:14.1"><span class="parno">mn12:14.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is not explained explicitly, but an example is found at <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn1:1.3.1">DN1:1.3.2</a>, where the Buddha knows the difference between Brahmadatta, who had faith in the triple gem, and Suppiya who did not. Thus <i lang="pi" translate="no">adhimutti</i> (“conviction”) means “faith, belief” rather than “disposition”. </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<p id="mn12:15.1"><span class="parno">mn12:15.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Exemplified by the Buddha when he surveyed the world after his awakening to see the diverse spiritual potentials of beings (<a href="../mn/mn26.html#mn26:20.20">MN26:21.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn85.html#profound">MN85:45.4</a>, <a href="../dn/dn14.html#dn14:3.4.19">DN14:3.6.1</a>, <a href="../sn/sn6.1.html#content">SN6.1</a>, <a href="../vi/kd1.html#p25">Khandhaka 1</a>). </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<p id="mn12:16.1"><span class="parno">mn12:16.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Corruption” is any mental factor that darkens and diminishes meditation; “cleansing” is anything that brightens and enhances it. “Emergence” refers to understanding the reasons why one comes out of a given state of meditation (eg. <a href="../mn/mn43.html#emerge">MN43:29.1</a>). <br>
The phrase “absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments” indicates that, although they are given various technical definitions, these are overlapping terms that describe in different ways the same field of deep meditation experiences. </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<p id="mn12:17.1"><span class="parno">mn12:17.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here we return to the final three of the six direct knowledges, which also form the final three of the ten powers. </span></span></span> Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<p id="mn12:18.1"><span class="parno">mn12:18.1</span>Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:19.1"><span class="parno">mn12:19.1</span>Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>

<p id="mn12:20.1"><span class="parno">mn12:20.1</span>A Realized One possesses these ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>


<p id="mn12:21.1"><span class="parno">mn12:21.1</span>When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: ‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.’ Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This seems harsh, but the suttas see such denigration of the Buddha as deeply wicked, since it closes off the path to Nibbana, as at <a href="../sn/sn42.9.html#withdraw">SN42.9</a> where a village chief accuses the Buddha of destroying families by encouraging renunciation. At <a href="../dn/dn24.html#1.16.13">DN24:1.16.13</a> the Buddha warns Sunakkhatta that the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta, without likewise giving up his speech, thought, and view, will not even be able to enter the Buddha’s presence, much less debate him.</span></span></span> Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say. Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn12:22.1"><span class="parno">mn12:22.1</span>Sāriputta, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These four “kinds of self-assurance” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vesārajja</i>) are also found at <a href="../an/an4.8.html#content">AN4.8</a>.

This roughly corresponds with January, the coldest month in northern India. </span></span></span> But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night.

<p id="mn12:51.1"><span class="parno">mn12:51.1</span>I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow. Then village louts would come up to me.

And they enjoy many jujube concoctions. I recall eating just a single jujube. You might think that at that time the jujubes must have been very big. But you should not see it like this. The jujubes then were at most the same size as today. Eating so very little, my body became severely emaciated.

Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well. Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun. Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly. Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there. Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out. </p>

<p id="mn12:62.1"><span class="parno">mn12:62.1</span>There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of wisdom. But when he’s old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his lucidity of wisdom.’ But you should not see it like this. For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This situates this discourse, and hence the Sunakkhatta cycle as a whole, near the end of the Buddha’s life. </span></span></span> Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Memory (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sati</i>), range (<i lang="pi" translate="no">gati</i>), retention (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dhiti</i>), and perfect lucidity of wisdom (<i lang="pi" translate="no">paññāveyyattiya</i>).  </span></span></span> Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree. That’s how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom. They’d bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again, and I would answer each question. They’d remember the answers and not ask the same question twice. And they’d pause only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, or spontaneous answers. And at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass away. Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s lucidity of wisdom. </p>

<p id="mn12:63.1"><span class="parno">mn12:63.1</span>And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.” </p>
