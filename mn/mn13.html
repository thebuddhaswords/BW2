<div lang="en">

<p id="mn13:1.1"><span class="parno">mn13:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>



<p id="mn13:2.1"><span class="parno">mn13:2.1</span>Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to them, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: </p>



<p id="mn13:3.1"><span class="parno">mn13:3.1</span>“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, and so do we.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This group of three—<i lang="pi" translate="no">kāma</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">rūpa</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vedanā</i>—is also found at <a href="../an/an3.126.html#content">AN3.126</a> and <a href="../an/an10.29.html#content">AN10.29</a>, where it also relates to the teachings of outsiders.</span></span></span> The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of forms, and so do we. The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings, and so do we.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text does not say what the wanderers understood by these three full understandings. The commentary says they spoke in reference to, respectively, the first absorption, the formless attainments, and the non-percipient state. </span></span></span> What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In questioning this, the wanderers display better discernment than many today, who leap all too readily from the discovery of something in common between religions to the assertion that they are therefore the same.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn13:4.1"><span class="parno">mn13:4.1</span>Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. They got up from their seat, thinking, “We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the quintessential Buddhist attitude when encountering something unknown: to neither accept nor reject, but inquire. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn13:5.1"><span class="parno">mn13:5.1</span>Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: </p>

<p id="mn13:6.1"><span class="parno">mn13:6.1</span>“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: ‘But reverends, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to sensual pleasures?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This set of three questions is a key analytical approach in the suttas. Without an appreciation of both the good and bad sides of things we cannot properly understand them and be free of craving for them. </span></span></span> What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to forms? What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to feelings?’ Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. </p>

<p id="mn13:7.1"><span class="parno">mn13:7.1</span>And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures? There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation: this is the gratification of sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:8.1"><span class="parno">mn13:8.1</span>And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures? It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as arithmetic, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. But they must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst. This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:9.1"><span class="parno">mn13:9.1</span>That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to accrue  money. If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying: ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’ This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:10.1"><span class="parno">mn13:10.1</span>That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money. But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it, thinking: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it. They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion: ‘What once was mine is gone.’ This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:11.1"><span class="parno">mn13:11.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend. Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and disputing, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords, resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:12.1"><span class="parno">mn13:12.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing. There they are struck with arrows and spears, and their heads are chopped off, resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:13.1"><span class="parno">mn13:13.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Bastions were “wetly plastered” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">addāvalepana</i>) for resistance from fire (<a href="../sn/sn35.243.html#addāvalepana">SN35.243</a>). </span></span></span> There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed by a superior force, and their heads are chopped off,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For “splashed with dung” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">chakaṇakāyapi osiñcanti</i>), PTS reads <i lang="pi" translate="no">pakkaṭṭhī</i>, but this word appears to be spurious. The commentary says <i lang="pi" translate="no">chakaṇakā</i> means “boiling cowdung”, but nothing in the word itself suggests “boiling”. The Chinese parallels at MA 99 and T 53 have “molten copper” <span lang="lzh">融銅</span>, while EA 21.9 has “molten iron” (<span lang="lzh">消鐵</span>). <br>
<i lang="pi" translate="no">Abhivagga</i> is only found here in Pali. The Atharvaveda (3.5.2, 6.54.2, 11.2.4) has <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhīvarga</i> apparently in the sense of “domain”. The commentary says <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhivagga</i> was a “hundred-toothed” weapon that crushed invaders of a castle. However, <i lang="pi" translate="no">vagga</i> has the recognized military sense of “cadre, company, platoon”, so I take <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhivagga</i> to mean “superior force”. </span></span></span> resulting in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:14.1"><span class="parno">mn13:14.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery. The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The commentary explains these punishments thus. “Porridge pot”: remove the top of the skull and drop in a hot iron ball so that the brains boil over. “Shell-shave”: grind the skull with gravel until it is smooth. “Rāhu”s mouth’: force open the mouth with a skewer, put in oil and wick, and light it so it burns like the sun swallowed by the titan Rāhu (<a href="../sn/sn2.8.html#content">SN2.8</a>). “Garland of fire”: smear the body with oil and set it alight. “Burning hand”: wrap the hand with oiled rags and set it alight. “Bulrush twist”: flay the skin from the neck down, then twist it into a band by which to hang the victim. “Bark dress”: cut the skin in strips and make it into a garment. “Antelope”: pin the bound victim to the ground and roast them alive. “Meat hook”: flay with double fish-hooks. “Coins”: slice off disks of flesh like coins. “Caustic pickle”: beat the victim, then rub the wounds with caustic solution. “Twisting bar”: pin the victim to the ground by the ears and twirl them by the feet. “Straw mat”: beat them until every bone is broken and the body becomes limp as a mattress.  </span></span></span> These result in death and deadly pain. This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in the present life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:15.1"><span class="parno">mn13:15.1</span>Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures, they conduct themselves badly by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The drawbacks are escalating, the point being that hell is worse than the punishments described above.</span></span></span> This is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Previous drawbacks pertained to what is “apparent in this very life” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sandiṭṭhika</i>), whereas this applies to “lives to come” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samparāyika</i>). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn13:16.1"><span class="parno">mn13:16.1</span>And what is the escape from sensual pleasures? Removing and giving up desire and greed for sensual pleasures: this is the escape from sensual pleasures.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This happens with the realization of non-return. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn13:17.1"><span class="parno">mn13:17.1</span>There are ascetics and brahmins who don’t truly understand sensual pleasures’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are. It’s impossible for them to completely understand sensual pleasures themselves, or to instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensual pleasures. There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand sensual pleasures’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are. It is possible for them to completely understand sensual pleasures themselves, or to instruct another so that, practicing accordingly, they will completely understand sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="mn13:18.1"><span class="parno">mn13:18.1</span>And what is the gratification of forms? Suppose there was a girl of the brahmins, aristocrats, or householders in her fifteenth or sixteenth year, neither too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too fat, neither too dark nor too fair. Is she not at the height of her beauty and prettiness?” </p>

<p id="mn13:18.3"><span class="parno">mn13:18.3</span>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="mn13:18.4"><span class="parno">mn13:18.4</span>“The pleasure and happiness that arise from this beauty and prettiness is the gratification of forms. </p>

<p id="mn13:19.1"><span class="parno">mn13:19.1</span>And what is the drawback of forms? Suppose that some time later you were to see that same sister—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy. </p>

<p id="mn13:19.3"><span class="parno">mn13:19.3</span>What do you think, mendicants? Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear?” </p>

<p id="mn13:19.5"><span class="parno">mn13:19.5</span>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="mn13:19.6"><span class="parno">mn13:19.6</span>“This is the drawback of forms. </p>

<p id="mn13:20.1"><span class="parno">mn13:20.1</span>Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same sister sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in her own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others. </p>

<p id="mn13:20.2"><span class="parno">mn13:20.2</span>What do you think, mendicants? Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear?” </p>

<p id="mn13:20.5"><span class="parno">mn13:20.5</span>“This too is the drawback of forms. </p>

<p id="mn13:21.1"><span class="parno">mn13:21.1</span>Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As shown in <a href="../mn/mn10.html#mn10:13.1">MN10:14.1</a>, this meditation proceeds not by objectifying the other’s corpse as repulsive, but by identifying “it”—the neuter-gendered <i lang="pi" translate="no">sarīra</i>—with one’s own body.  </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn13:21.3"><span class="parno">mn13:21.3</span>What do you think, mendicants? Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear?” </p>

<p id="mn13:23-28.1"><span class="parno">mn13:23-28.1</span>Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground.

Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here an ankle bone, there a shin-bone, here a thigh-bone, there a hip-bone, here a rib-bone, there a back-bone, here an arm-bone, there a neck-bone, here a jaw-bone, there a tooth, here the skull. … </p>

<p id="mn13:29.1"><span class="parno">mn13:29.1</span>Furthermore, suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been reduced to white bones, the color of shells … decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … bones rotted and crumbled to powder. </p>
