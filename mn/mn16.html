<h3>MN16: Cetokhila Sutta — Hard-heartedness</h3>

<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn16:1.1"><span class="parno">mn16:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn16:1.5"><span class="parno">mn16:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="mn16:2.1"><span class="parno">mn16:2.1</span>“Mendicants, when a mendicant has not given up five kinds of hard-heartedness and severed five shackles of the heart, it’s not possible for them to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The two sets of five are also found at <a href="../an/an10.14.html#content">AN10.14</a>. The five kinds of “hard-heartedness” are also at <a href="../an/an5.205.html#content">AN5.205</a>, <a href="../an/an9.71.html#content">AN9.71</a>, <a href="../dn/dn33.html#dn33:2.1.76">DN33:2.1.76</a>, and <a href="../dn/dn34.html#dn34:1.6.19">DN34:1.6.23</a>, and the five “shackles of the heart” are at <a href="../an/an5.206.html#content">AN5.206</a>, <a href="../an/an9.72.html#content">AN9.72</a>, <a href="../an/an9.82.html#content">AN9.82</a>, <a href="../an/an9.92.html#content">AN9.92</a>, and <a href="../dn/dn33.html#dn33:2.1.76">DN33:2.1.84</a>. <br>
While this sutta is addressed as normal to the <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhus</i>, the parallels at <a href="../an/an10.14.html#content">AN10.14</a>, MA 206, and EA 51.4 are all addressed to both monks and nuns. This is one of the instances showing that the term <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhu</i> is meant to include both monks and nuns, a common feature of Pali where the default gender is masculine. Hence I translate <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhikkhu</i> with “mendicant”, which is both literal and gender-neutral, unless it is clear that males are meant, in which case I use “monk”.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn16:3.1"><span class="parno">mn16:3.1</span>What are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Hard-heartedness” or “emotional barrenness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">cetokhila</i>): <i lang="pi" translate="no">ceto</i> is one of several words for “mind, heart” and is functionally equivalent to <i lang="pi" translate="no">citta</i>, yet it tends to be used in contexts that emphasize the emotional dimensions of the mind such as here. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Khila</i> is said, in the commentary to <a href="../sn/snp1.2.html#content">Snp1.2</a>, to be land so barren that nothing grows even if it rains for four months.</span></span></span> Firstly, a mendicant has doubts about the Teacher. They’re uncertain, undecided, and lacking confidence. This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving. This is the first kind of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn16:4.1"><span class="parno">mn16:4.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant has doubts about the teaching … This is the second kind of hard-heartedness. </p>

<p id="mn16:5.1"><span class="parno">mn16:5.1</span>They have doubts about the Saṅgha … This is the third kind of hard-heartedness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn16:6.1"><span class="parno">mn16:6.1</span>They have doubts about the training …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While “training” includes the threefold training of ethics, meditation, and wisdom, it specially indicates the foundational training in ethics. This is emphasized in the Chinese parallels, which mention the “precepts” here.</span></span></span> This is the fourth kind of hard-heartedness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn16:7.1"><span class="parno">mn16:7.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant is angry and upset with their spiritual companions, resentful and closed off. This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth kind of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up. </p>

<p>These are the five kinds of hard-heartedness they haven’t given up. </p>

<p id="mn16:8.1"><span class="parno">mn16:8.1</span>What are the five shackles of the heart they haven’t severed? Firstly, a mendicant isn’t free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving. This is the first shackle of the heart they haven’t severed. </p>

<p id="mn16:9.1"><span class="parno">mn16:9.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for the body … This is the second shackle of the heart. </p>

<p id="mn16:10.1"><span class="parno">mn16:10.1</span>Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t free of greed for form … This is the third shackle of the heart. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn16:11.1"><span class="parno">mn16:11.1</span>They eat as much as they like until their belly is full, then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing … This is the fourth heart shackle. </p>

<p id="mn16:12.1"><span class="parno">mn16:12.1</span>They lead the spiritual life hoping to be reborn in one of the orders of gods, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This being so, their mind doesn’t incline toward keenness, commitment, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth shackle of the heart they haven’t severed. </p>

<p id="mn16:26.1"><span class="parno">mn16:26.1</span>They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The four <i lang="pi" translate="no">iddhipada</i> are included in the so-called 37 “wings to awakening” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bodhipakkhiyadhamma</i>). They are an alternate presentation of the path of meditation, with a special focus on developing <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>. It seems the Buddha designed this presentation of Dhamma to appeal to the many meditators who are fascinated by psychic powers, with the aim to lead them on to the higher goal of liberation. <br> “Enthusiasm” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">chanda</i>) is the desire or will to practice the Dhamma for liberation. </span></span></span> the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">One who has the requisite enthusiasm will put forth “effort” to achieve the goal. </span></span></span> the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">When striving, one will purify and develop the “mind”. When <i lang="pi" translate="no">citta</i> appears in meditation contexts, it is often virtually a synonym of <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i> (see eg. <i lang="pi" translate="no">cittabhāvanā</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">cittasampadā</i>). </span></span></span> the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. And the fifth is sheer vigor.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The mind clarified in <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i> can investigate the true nature of reality. <br> <i lang="pi" translate="no">Ussoḷhi</i> (“vigor”) is similar in meaning to “energy” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">viriya</i>) and “active effort” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhāra</i>), underscoring the importance of effort here.</span></span></span> A mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors, including vigor, is capable of breaking out, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Yogakkhema</i> (“sanctuary from the yoke”) is a metaphor for Nibbana that draws from the literal sense of <i lang="pi" translate="no">khema</i> as an oasis or sanctuary for men and beasts. After a hard day’s journey, a caravan would stop to rest, “unyoke” the draft animals, lay down the burden, and refresh themselves in the cool waters.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p>Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This simile recurs at <a href="../mn/mn53.html#hensimile">MN53:19.2</a> and elsewhere.</span></span></span> And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. </p>

<p>Even if that chicken doesn’t wish: ‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still they can break out and hatch safely. </p>

<p id="mn16:27.7"><span class="parno">mn16:27.7</span>In the same way, a mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors, including vigor, is capable of breaking out, becoming awakened, and reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.” </p>

<p id="mn16:27.8"><span class="parno">mn16:27.8</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>
