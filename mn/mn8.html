<p id="mn8:1.1"><span class="parno">mn8:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Of the two parallels to this sutta, MA 91 takes place at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, while EA 47.9 is set in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground at Rājagaha. The specifics of narrative backgrounds often vary; they are not “the Buddha’s word”, but rather were added by editors at some point.  
</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:2.1"><span class="parno">mn8:2.1</span>Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There are various Cundas whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the great disciples (<a href="../mn/mn118.html#content">MN118:</a>, <a href="../an/an6.17.html#content">AN6.17</a>), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs (<a href="../an/an6.46.html#content">AN6.46</a>, <a href="../an/an10.24.html#content">AN10.24</a>). He once stayed with Channa and Sāriputta (<a href="../mn/mn144.html##content">MN144</a>, <a href="../sn/sn35.87.html#content">SN35.87</a>); the commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta’s younger brother. They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta (<a href="../sn/sn47.13.html#content">SN47.13</a>) and Mahāvīra (<a href="../dn/dn29.html#dn29:1.6">DN29:2.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn104.html#Cunda">MN104</a>), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:4.38.7">DN16:4.39.1</a> = <a href=<a href="../ud/ud8.5.html#content">Ud8.5</a> to be the same person, but he is there performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda. Thus there may have been one person known by different names, or several people whose stories have become conflated. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:3.1"><span class="parno">mn8:3.1</span>“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are discussed many times in the suttas, for example doctrines of the self at <a href="../mn/mn2.html#mn2:8.2">MN2:8.1</a> and <a href="../mn/mn44.html#content">MN44</a>; of the cosmos at <a href="../mn/mn63.html#content">MN63</a> and <a href="../mn/mn72.html#content">MN72</a>; and of both at <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn1:1.30.1">DN1:1.30.1</a> and <a href="../mn/mn102.html##content">MN102:14.1</a>. </span></span></span> How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">ādimeva</i> elsewhere occurs only when the Buddha gives a mendicant instructions for a retreat. Typically (<a href="../sn/sn47.3.html#ādimeva">SN47.3</a>, <a href="../sn/sn47.15.html#ādimeva">SN47.15</a>, <a href="../sn/sn47.16.html#ādimeva">SN47.16</a>) he says to “purify the starting point of skillful qualities”, namely ethics (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sīla</i>) and views (<i lang="pi" translate="no">diṭṭhi</i>), on the latter of which Mahācunda is seeking clarification. <br> In the Pali the question is phrased directly and is sometimes translated “do they give them up?”, but the idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">evametāsaṁ</i> shifts the sense to “how do they give them up?” (<a href="../mn/mn74.html#evametāsaṁ">MN74:6.14</a>, <a href="../mn/mn137.html#evametāsaṁ">MN137:16.8</a>). And that is indeed the answer the Buddha gives. The commentary explains it similarly (<i lang="pi" translate="no">etena upāyena etāsaṁ</i>), and both Chinese texts have <span lang="lzh">云何</span> here, which typically stands for <i lang="pi" translate="no">kathaṁ</i> (“how”).</span></span></span> </p>


<hr>


<p id="mn8:3.4"><span class="parno">mn8:3.4</span>“Cunda, there are many different views that arise in the world connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos. A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise, where they settle in, and where they operate as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the insight of stream-entry, where wrong views are fully abandoned by means of the clarified wisdom that sees the truth of conditionality. The remainder of the sutta discusses the practice leading to this point.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:4.1"><span class="parno">mn8:4.1</span>It’s possible that a certain mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, might enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The term “self-effacement” that lends the sutta its title is Pali <i lang="pi" translate="no">sallekha</i>, which has the sense of “rubbing out” (an inscription or mark). It is associated with such virtues as contentment, seclusion, and simplicity (eg. <a href="../mn/mn3.html#mn3:3.17">MN3:3.23</a>). Here it refers to the strength of character to persist in “effacing” unwholesome qualities through developing their opposites, no matter what others might do. <br> Not to be confused with the Jain <i lang="pi" translate="no">sallekhanā</i>, where practitioners at the end of life refuse all food (Tattvārthasūtra 7.22). In fact, this sutta appears to emphasize the gentle nature of the Buddha’s approach in deliberate contrast with the stern austerities of the Jains. </span></span></span> But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The sutta is not deprecating the <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i>, for they are a fundamental part of the early Buddhist path, and as such are included later under the heading of “right immersion” (<a href="#mn8:12.17">MN8:12.19 below</a>). Indeed, the sutta ends with the Buddha encouraging Cunda to practice <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhāna</i>. Rather, this text emphasizes the need to actively develop all aspects of the path, humble or exalted, and integrate them in every aspect of life, rather than solely relying on meditation in seclusion. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:5.1"><span class="parno">mn8:5.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, might enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’. </p>

<p id="mn8:6.1"><span class="parno">mn8:6.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, might enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’. </p>

<p id="mn8:7.1"><span class="parno">mn8:7.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, might enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’. </p>

<p id="mn8:8.1"><span class="parno">mn8:8.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’. </p>

<p id="mn8:9.1"><span class="parno">mn8:9.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’. </p>

<p id="mn8:10.1"><span class="parno">mn8:10.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, might enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’. </p>

<p id="mn8:11.1"><span class="parno">mn8:11.1</span>It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, might enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They might think they’re practicing self-effacement. But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; they’re called ‘peaceful meditations’. </p>

<h4 class="subheading">1. The Exposition of Self-Effacement </h4>

<p id="mn8:12.1"><span class="parno">mn8:12.1</span>Now, Cunda, you should work on self-effacement in each of the following ways.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The phrase “work on self-effacement” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sallekho karaṇīyo</i>) recurs in each clause but is abbreviated in translation. It echoes the phrase <i lang="pi" translate="no">sikkhā karaṇīyā</i> (“this training should be done”) which ends each of the Vinaya “training rules”. Both cases emphasize the active application of effort. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:12.2"><span class="parno">mn8:12.2</span>‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The list of unskillful qualities forms the skeleton of the rest of the sutta, being repeated five times with variations in the presentation. The Pali has 44 items, while MA 91 has 31 and EA 47.9 has 16. I note where the items appear in standard doctrinal lists. <br> Non-cruelty is mentioned first as it is the foundation of good qualities and the first moral precept, to not kill.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn8:12.3"><span class="parno">mn8:12.3</span>‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These ten make up the ten ways of doing of skillful deeds. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:12.4"><span class="parno">mn8:12.4</span>‘Others will steal, but here we will not steal.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.7"><span class="parno">mn8:12.7</span>‘Others will speak divisively, but here we will not speak divisively.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.8"><span class="parno">mn8:12.8</span>‘Others will speak harshly, but here we will not speak harshly.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.9"><span class="parno">mn8:12.9</span>‘Others will talk nonsense, but here we will not talk nonsense.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.11"><span class="parno">mn8:12.11</span>‘Others will have ill will, but here we will not have ill will.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.12"><span class="parno">mn8:12.12</span>‘Others will have wrong view, but here we will have right view.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This item performs double-duty as both the last of the ten ways of doing skillful deeds and the first of the noble eight (or ten) fold path.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:12.13"><span class="parno">mn8:12.13</span>‘Others will have wrong thought, but here we will have right thought.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.14"><span class="parno">mn8:12.14</span>‘Others will have wrong speech, but here we will have right speech.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.20"><span class="parno">mn8:12.20</span>‘Others will have wrong knowledge, but here we will have right knowledge.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These two items are sometimes added to the eightfold path to make ten (eg. <a href="../mn/mn117.html#tenfoldpath">MN117:35.13</a>). They are missing in both parallels.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:12.21"><span class="parno">mn8:12.21</span>‘Others will have wrong freedom, but here we will have right freedom.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.22"><span class="parno">mn8:12.22</span>‘Others will be overcome with dullness and drowsiness, but here we will be rid of dullness and drowsiness.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is the third of the five hindrances, and the final two follow in sequence. The first two of the hindrances appear above as “covetousness” and “ill will” in the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. Notably, the same pattern occurs in MA 91, which speaks to a common ancestor on this point. This shows that these items were organized to eliminate repetition, but in other cases (such as the kinds of wrong speech and wrong action) items do repeat.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn8:12.23"><span class="parno">mn8:12.23</span>‘Others will be restless, but here we will not be restless.’ </p>

<p id="mn8:12.24"><span class="parno">mn8:12.24</span>‘Others will have doubts, but here we will have gone beyond doubt.’ </p>

Before we do anything, we think of doing it, and that in itself is powerful, as it sets the mind in a certain direction. For the Buddha, the mental intentions that underlie bodily behaviors are crucial, whereas for the Jains it is the bodily behaviors themselves that matter. </span></span></span> That’s why you should give rise to the following thoughts. ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’ ‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’ … ‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’ </p>
