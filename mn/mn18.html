<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn18:1.1"><span class="parno">mn18:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is one of the most famous discourses in studies of early Buddhism, largely due to the ground-breaking analysis by Venerable Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda in his 1971  monograph <em>Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought</em>, which established the meaning of <i lang="pi" translate="no">papañca</i> as “conceptual proliferation”. <br> It is the first of the “thought trilogy”, a series of discourses that deal with the activity of thinking in meditation (also <a href="../mn/mn19.html#content">MN19</a>, <a href="../mn/mn20.html#content">MN20</a>).</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Banyan Tree Monastery (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nigrodhārāma</i>) was the normal residence for the Buddha and his disciples in the Sakyan republic. It was named, according to northern traditions, after the banyan trees that grew there, while the Pali commentaries say it was named after a Sakyan called Nigrodha who donated it. The two stories are not incompatible, as the owner could have been known by his most famous attribute, his banyan grove. It has been identified by stupas located next to the village Kudan, just north of the India-Nepal border.  </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:2.1"><span class="parno">mn18:2.1</span>Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">It would have been about thirty minutes walk to Kapilavatthu.</span></span></span> He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood for the day’s meditation,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Great Wood (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahāvana</i>) was a favorite meditation place of the Buddha. The commentaries say it was a stretch of wilderness that reached as far as the Himalayas on one side (200 km) and the ocean on the other (1000 km). Later tradition says that a town should have three woods: a “great wood” for wilderness (<i lang="pi" translate="no">mahāvana</i>); a “prosperity wood” for resources (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sirivana</i>); and an “ascetic wood” for spiritual practice (<i lang="pi" translate="no">tapovana</i>).</span></span></span> plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood-apple tree to meditate. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:3.1"><span class="parno">mn18:3.1</span>Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Daṇḍapāṇi was said to be the brother of the Buddha’s birth mother Māyā and foster mother Mahāpajāpatī (Mahāvaṁsa 2.19), or else the father of the Buddha’s former wife Yasodharā (or Gopā, Lalitavistara 12.15). Both could be true, making Siddhattha’s wife his cousin. Reading between the lines, it seems Daṇḍapāṇi nursed a grudge against the Buddha. This would be understandable if Siddhattha’s birth resulted in the death of one of Daṇḍapāṇi’s sisters, while the other sister was left distraught when he went forth; and even more so if he abandoned Daṇḍapāṇi’s daughter with their newborn son.</span></span></span> plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha, “What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">There is a minor Vinaya training against teaching anyone with “a staff in their hand” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">daṇḍapāṇi</i>, <a href="../vi/bu-vb-sk58.html#content">Bhikkhu  Sekhiya 58</a>). This was evidently laid down because a staff could be used as a weapon, and hence was associated with royal authority or with policing and the exercise of violence. In a vision interpreted at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.6.1.13, a man with staff in hand is identified with wrath (<i lang="pi" translate="no">krodha</i>). </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:4.1"><span class="parno">mn18:4.1</span>“Good sir, my doctrine is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In the face of Daṇḍapāṇi’s evidently hostile attitude, the Buddha addresses his uncle with the respectful <i lang="pi" translate="no">āvuso</i> (“sir”), and emphasizes non-conflict in line with his claim that, “I do not argue with the world; it is the world that argues with me” (<a href="../sn/sn22.94.html#content">SN22.94</a>). <br>
The expression “perceptions do not underlie” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saññā nānusenti</i>) is unique to this context and must pertain to the highly-charged relation between the Buddha and Daṇḍapāṇi. “Perception” is that mode of knowing that interprets the present in terms of the past, and hence it might sometimes be translated as “recognition”. The Buddha, by asserting he is no longer bound by past perceptions, is hinting that this is how Daṇḍapāṇi can get over his grudge. </span></span></span> That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:5.1"><span class="parno">mn18:5.1</span>When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and left leaning on his staff.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the Buddha succeeding in deescalating possible conflict, clearly the teaching did not have the desired effect, at least right away. <br> Māra responds in the same way at <a href="../sn/sn4.21.html#waggled">SN4.21</a>.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:6.1"><span class="parno">mn18:6.1</span>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out, and told the mendicants what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:6.14"><span class="parno">mn18:6.14</span>When he had spoken, one of the mendicants said to him, “But sir, asserting what doctrine does the Buddha not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “Buddha” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhagavā</i>) is the subject and object respectively of this sentence and the next, a detail not always captured in translations.  </span></span></span> And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The following passage, with its longer explanation below, is one of the most dense and enigmatic statements in the suttas. I shall explain the terms as they occur, and draw out the structure of the argument as it is revealed.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:8.1"><span class="parno">mn18:8.1</span>“Mendicant, judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Judgment” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhā</i>) is the way we “appraise” or “assess” ourselves, especially in relation to others (cf. <a href="../mn/mn1.html#mn1:3.3">MN1:3.3</a>, <a href="../dn/dn1.html#dn1:1.3.2">DN1:1.3.2</a>). <br> “Proliferation” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">papañca</i>) is the compulsion of the mind to spread out in endless inner commentary that hides reality. <br> “Beset” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">samudācaranti</i>) conveys the sense that the person is overwhelmed and swamped, no longer the agent of their existence. <br> A “person” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">purisa</i>) is the conventional sense of self that arises from desire and identification.</span></span></span> If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Ettha</i> (“regarding that”) refers back to <i lang="pi" translate="no">yatonidānaṁ</i> (“the source from which”) in the previous line. This “source” has not yet been identified.</span></span></span> just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Buddha uses “underlying tendencies” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">anusaya</i>) for the normal set of seven, implying that these are meant by “perceptions” in the phrase “perceptions do not underlie the brahmin” at <a href="../mn/mn18.html#mn18:3.1">MN18:4.1</a>. <br> He identifies the doctrine that leads to peace as the ending of these tendencies that create proliferation and judgment about the supposed “person”.  </span></span></span> This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">By this the Buddha indicates arahantship.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn18:9.1"><span class="parno">mn18:9.1</span>That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">While the Buddha usually took pains to make his teaching explicit, he sometimes left his students with puzzling or enigmatic statements as a way of encouraging them to figure them out for themselves.</span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:10.1"><span class="parno">mn18:10.1</span>Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered, “The Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha?” </p>
	<hr>

<p id="mn18:10.8"><span class="parno">mn18:10.8</span>Then those mendicants thought, “This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Mahākaccāna was one of the great disciples, whose teachings specially emphasized the incisive analysis of consciousness through the lens of the six senses. He was said to be the most skilled at given detailed explanations of brief teachings (<a href="../an/an1.197.html#content">AN1.197</a>), a skill he displayed also at <a href="../mn/mn133.html#content">MN133</a>, <a href="../mn/mn138.html#content">MN138</a>, and <a href="../an/an10.172.html#content">AN10.172</a>. Later he was to settle to the southwest in Avanti, where he established the Dhamma in the region. </span></span></span> He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha. Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.” </p>


<hr>

<p id="mn18:11.1"><span class="parno">mn18:11.1</span>Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said: “May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:12.1"><span class="parno">mn18:12.1</span>“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter. For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” </p>

<p id="mn18:13.1"><span class="parno">mn18:13.1</span>“Certainly he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of freedom from death, the lord of truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer. </p>

<p>Still, Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary recital given by the Buddha. Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.” </p>

<p id="mn18:14.1"><span class="parno">mn18:14.1</span>“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>

<p id="mn18:14.2"><span class="parno">mn18:14.2</span>“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahākaccāna said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:15.1"><span class="parno">mn18:15.1</span>“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief summary recital, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Passage for recitation” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">uddesa</i>, which is used for a short passage to be memorized verbatim, to which is then attached a longer analysis. </span></span></span> ‘Judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person. If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise, just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and disputes, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies. This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.’ This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary recital. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn18:16.1"><span class="parno">mn18:16.1</span>Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a requirement for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate is the source from which judgments driven by proliferating perceptions beset a person. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In this passage, Mahākaccāna deftly unfolds the meaning inside the syntax. For consciousness, contact, and feeling, he repeats the standard analysis of sense experience linked to dependent origination (<a href="../sn/sn12.43.html#content">SN12.43</a>), where each item, expressed as a noun, leads to the next like falling dominoes. Pivoting on feeling (cp. <a href="../sn/sn12.43.html#feeling">SN12.43 verse 3</a>, <a href="../dn/dn15.html#dn15:18.1">DN15:18.5</a>), he switches to verbs; feeling exerts a force that motivates desire, even though desire itself is left unstated here. In the Pali, the subject of the verbs is implicit, assuming an agent who is feeling, perceiving, thinking, and proliferating. But with proliferating, the syntax changes again. The agent is fully manifest as the “person” who, tragically, is no longer the subject in control of the process, but the hapless object of the swarm of judgments that beset them. It is at this point that time is introduced, as the concept of the “person” binds the mind to suffering in the three periods of time. If we relate this to the origin story, Daṇḍapāṇi has become the “person” he is, full of bitterness and resentment, because of his chronic ruminations on perceived injustices of the past. <br> Mahākaccāna identifies the “source” left undefined in the Buddha’s statement with proliferation itself. <br> This passage also clarifies the grammatical relationship between the main terms: perception leads to proliferation and proliferation results in judgments.</span></span></span> </p>

This occurs with respect to ideas known by the mind in the past, future, and present.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here, rather unsatisfactorily, “ideas” renders <i lang="pi" translate="no">dhammā</i>. <i lang="pi" translate="no">Dhamma</i> in the sense of “what is known by the mind rather than the senses” doesn’t readily map on to a common concept in English. Attempts include “mind objects”, which introduces the Abhidhammic idea of “object” to the suttas, where it is entirely absent; or “(mental) phenomena”, which doesn’t really fit the common meaning of “phenomena” as being what is perceptible by the senses. Etymologically, the correct word would be “noumena”, but this is used only as a technical term in Kantian philosophy where it has a rather different sense. Ñāṇamoḷi’s “idea” might be the least bad option, in the sense of a thought, concept, sensation, or image present in consciousness. </span></span></span> </p>
