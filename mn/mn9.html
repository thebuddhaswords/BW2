<p id="mn9:1.1"><span class="parno">mn9:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Chinese and Sanskrit parallels depict this discourse as a conversation between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita, a context that appears to have been lost in the Pali. The sutta proceeds by starting with a simple analysis of right view, gradually stepping into deeper waters. Much of the discourse is framed in terms of dependent origination, but it focuses on the dependently originated phenomena, rather than the process of causality (see <a href="../sn/sn12.20.html#content">SN12.20</a> for this distinction). </span></span></span> “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn9:1.5"><span class="parno">mn9:1.5</span>“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:2.1"><span class="parno">mn9:2.1</span>“Reverends, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’. How do you define a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">In other words, a stream-enterer. In <a href="../mn/mn141.html#Sāriputta">MN141:5.6</a>, Sāriputta is said to teach students as far as as stream-entry, while his friend Moggallāna leads them to arahantship. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn9:2.3"><span class="parno">mn9:2.3</span>“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>

<p id="mn9:2.6"><span class="parno">mn9:2.6</span>“Well then, reverends, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>

<p id="mn9:2.7"><span class="parno">mn9:2.7</span>“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:3.1"><span class="parno">mn9:3.1</span>“A noble disciple understands the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed. </span></span></span> When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:4.1"><span class="parno">mn9:4.1</span>But what is the unskillful and what is its root? And what is the skillful and what is its root? Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Note that covetousness, ill will, and wrong view are strong forms of greed, hate, and delusion respectively. </span></span></span> This is called the unskillful. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:5.1"><span class="parno">mn9:5.1</span>And what is the root of the unskillful? Greed, hate, and delusion. This is called the root of the unskillful. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:6.1"><span class="parno">mn9:6.1</span>And what is the skillful? Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and right view.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are the “ten ways of doing skillful deeds” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dasakusalakammapathā</i>). There is a detailed explanation at <a href="../mn/mn41.html#principled">MN41:7.1</a>.  </span></span></span> This is called the skillful. </p>

<p id="mn9:7.1"><span class="parno">mn9:7.1</span>And what is the root of the skillful? Contentment, love, and understanding. This is called the root of the skillful. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:8.1"><span class="parno">mn9:8.1</span>A noble disciple understands in this way the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This passage, which is repeated throughout the sutta, indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). The commentary records a discussion of this problem, but in fact it is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. This shows how difficulties in the Pali text can sometimes lead to fruitless discussions in the absence of the broader context offered by parallels.  </span></span></span> When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:9.1"><span class="parno">mn9:9.1</span>Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question: “But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses. </span></span></span> </p>
<a id="nutrient"></a>
<p id="mn9:10.1"><span class="parno">mn9:10.1</span>“There might, reverends. A noble disciple understands fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sāriputta introduces the framework of the four noble truths, but structured in terms of “fuel” rather than suffering. <br> “Fuel” (or “food” or “nutriment”, <i lang="pi" translate="no">āhāra</i>) refers to both the thing that acts as a condition, fuel, or support, as well as the internal grasping and attachment to that thing. Its use as a philosophical term appears to be an innovation by the Buddha, replacing the <i lang="pi" translate="no">anna</i> so dear to Vedic seers.</span></span></span> When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:11.1"><span class="parno">mn9:11.1</span>But what is fuel? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation? These four fuels maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those about to be born.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also at <a href="../mn/mn38.html#fuel">MN38:15.1</a>, <a href="../sn/sn12.11.html#content">SN12.11</a>, <a href="../sn/sn12.12.html#content">SN12.12</a>, <a href="../sn/sn12.63.html#content">SN12.63</a>, <a href="../sn/sn12.64.html#content">SN12.64</a>; cp <a href="../sn/snp1.8.html#abouttobeborn">Snp1.8</a>. <br>
“About to be born” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">sambhavesī</i>, which I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading as a future active participle, although the commentary takes it in the sense “seeking” to be born. Compare such Sanskrit constructions as Rig Veda 1.66.8, <i lang="pi" translate="no">yamo ha jāto yamo janitvaṁ</i> (“the twin that is born and the twin about to be born”) and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.3.1.24, <i lang="pi" translate="no">bhūtaṁ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṁ ca janiṣyamāṇaṁ</i> (“has become and will be, born and to be born”). <br>
The phrase is one of several in the suttas that appears to indicate an intermediate state between one life and the next, despite the fact that this view is formally rejected by the Theravada Abhidhamma (Kv 8.2).</span></span></span> What four? Edible food, whether solid or subtle; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Coarse edible food sustains the bodies of beings in the human and animal realms, while fine edible food sustains the gods and ancestors, a belief intertwined with the Vedic notion that the gods partake of the food offered in sacrifice (eg. Rig Veda 1.187). <br> “Contact” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">phassa</i>) is the interaction between the inner and outer worlds, allowing us to situate ourselves in a sensory world full of fears and joys, stimulating feeling and hence the craving for more. <br> “Volition” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">manosañcetanā</i>) allows us to act in the world revealed by the senses and secure further “fuel”. <br> “Consciousness” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>) is aware of all this, experiencing suffering, and giving rise to a new “name and form” in a future life in a fruitless search to find a world free of pain. Thus the four “fuels” can be considered as a distinctive perspective on dependent origination, which is expanded further in the subsequent items.</span></span></span> Fuel originates from craving. Fuel ceases when craving ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of fuel is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The word <i lang="pi" translate="no">āhāra</i> (“fuel”, “food”, “nutriment”) means literally “intake”, and is etymologically parallel to <i lang="pi" translate="no">upādāna</i>, “grasping”, “uptake”. Both terms have dual senses, on the one hand denoting fuel or sustenance, and on the other grasping and attachment. That is why here (as at <a href="../mn/mn38.html#āhāra">MN38:16.1</a>), <i lang="pi" translate="no">āhāra</i> is created by craving, just like <i lang="pi" translate="no">upādāna</i> in the standard sequence (<a href="../mn/mn38.html#upādāna">MN38:17.8</a>). </span></span></span> right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:12.1"><span class="parno">mn9:12.1</span>A noble disciple understands in this way fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’.

<hr>

<p id="mn9:13.1"><span class="parno">mn9:13.1</span>Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question: “But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?” </p>

<p id="mn9:14.1"><span class="parno">mn9:14.1</span>“There might, reverends. A noble disciple understands suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here Sāriputta gives the classic statement on the four noble truths in terms of suffering (<i lang="pi" translate="no">dukkha</i>).</span></span></span> When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching. </p>

<hr>

<p>But what is suffering? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation? Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The definitions of the four noble truths are direct quotes from the Buddha’s first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta (<a href="../sn/sn56.11.html#nobletruths">SN56.11</a>). They are notably emphasized by Sāriputta, who delves even further into them (<a href="../mn/mn28.html#nobletruths">MN28:3.2</a>, <a href="../mn/mn141.html#content">MN141</a>), as he does later in this sutta also.</span></span></span> This is called suffering. </p>

<p>And what is the origin of suffering? It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure wherever it lands. That is,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This definition clarifies two common misunderstandings. First, not all desire causes suffering, for some kinds of desire lead out of suffering (<a href="../sn/sn51.15.html#content">SN51.15</a>). Second, rebirth is not a tangential part of the Buddha’s teachings, uncritically inherited from cultural suppositions; it is baked into the fundamental meaning of the four noble truths. <br> The idiom <i lang="pi" translate="no">tatratatra</i> (literally “there, there”) is not selective (“here and there”) but distributive (“everywhere”). By taking pleasure in sense experience, the mind binds itself to the need for continued stimulation in future lives. The distancing sense “there” is important, for craving does not merely satisfy itself with what it currently experiences, but must always seek out renewed gratification. For an Upaniṣadic precursor, see the note to the same idiom at <a href="../mn/mn2.html#8.8">MN2:8.8</a>. </span></span></span> craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Craving is a primal desire or hunger, often unconscious. <br>
“Craving for sensual pleasures” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kāmataṇhā</i>): the desire to experience pleasure through any of the five senses. <br>
“Craving for continued existence” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">bhavataṇhā</i>): the desire to continue living in some form after death. <br>
“Craving to end existence” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vibhavataṇhā</i>): the desire to annihilate the self. </span></span></span> This is called the origin of suffering. </p>

<p>And what is the cessation of suffering? It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to it.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These terms are used widely in different senses, but here they are all synonyms of “extinction” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nibbāna</i>). <br>
Note especially the appearance of <i lang="pi" translate="no">cāga</i> (“giving”) here. Giving is regarded as the most basic foundation of moral practice, yet even in its simplest form it partakes of the same nature as Nibbana. </span></span></span> This is called the cessation of suffering. </p>

<p>And what is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view … right immersion. This is called the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn9:19.1"><span class="parno">mn9:19.1</span>A noble disciple understands in this way suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’.

<p id="mn9:20.1"><span class="parno">mn9:20.1</span>Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question: “But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?” </p>

<p id="mn9:21.1"><span class="parno">mn9:21.1</span>“There might, reverends. A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is a nice example of Sāriputta’s analytical genius. He picks up “old age and death” from the explanation of “suffering” and treats it within the framework of the four noble truths. This creates continuity with the previous sections, as well as situating it within the Buddha’s teachings as a whole, since all footprints fit in an elephant’s footprint (<a href="../mn/mn28.html#nobletruths">MN28:2.1</a>). Further, he <em>deepens</em> understanding by applying the four noble truths recursively, bringing small details into close focus. Meanwhile, this item, following on from “suffering”, leads into the familiar sequence of items from dependent origination.
