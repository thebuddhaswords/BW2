<div lang="en">

<p id="mn31:1.1"><span class="parno">mn31:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This discourse is a favorite among monastics, depicting an ideal life of simplicity and friendship. The introduction recurs at <a href="../vi/kd10.html#48">Khandhaka 10</a> and, with a different teaching portion, at <a href="../mn/mn128.html#mn128:7.11">MN128:8.1</a>. In both those cases it is set after the Buddha left the quarreling monks of Kosambī. <br>
This discourse and <a href="../mn/mn128.html#content">MN128</a> appear to be influenced by Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3, a famous dialogue where an unusually reluctant Yājñavalkya is repeatedly pressed by King Janaka to reveal the true nature of a person’s light. At <a href="../sn/sn7.9.html#content">SN7.9</a> this passage is alluded to directly.</span></span></span> </span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Ñātika (also spelled <i lang="pi" translate="no">nātika</i>, or <i lang="pi" translate="no">nādika</i>; Sanskrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">jñātṛka</i>; Prākrit <i lang="pi" translate="no">nāyika</i>) was the clan to which the Jain leader Mahāvīra (called Nāṭaputta, i.e. Ñātiputta) belonged. This is the chief town of the clan. It was part of the Vajjian Federation (See <a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:2.4.2">DN16:2.5.1</a>). <br>
Over a millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction methods, but in the Buddha’s day most buildings were wood. This is the only brick building mentioned in the suttas, although brick construction is also discussed in the Vinaya. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn31:2.1"><span class="parno">mn31:2.1</span>Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Anuruddha was the brother of Ānanda and Mahānāma (<a href="../vi/kd17.html#content">Khandhaka 17</a>) which, according to the commentary, makes the Buddha his cousin. He was an exponent of mindfulness meditation (<a href="../sn/sn52.1.html#content">SN52.1</a>, etc.) and master of clairvoyance (<a href="../an/an1.188-197.html#p3">AN1.192</a>. <br>
Kimbila was one of the seven leading Sakyans, including Anuruddha and Ānanda, who went forth together (<a href="../vi/kd17.html#1.4.1">Khandhaka 17</a>). <br>
Several Nandiyas are known in the suttas, one of whom was a Sakyan (<a href="../sn/sn55.40.html#content">SN55.40</a>, <a href="../an/an11.13.html#content">AN11.13</a>; the root <i lang="pi" translate="no">nand</i> (“joy”) was a popular choice for Sakyan names: Ānanda, Nanda, Upananda). While Nandiya is not mentioned as having gone forth with the seven, Kimbila refers to their group as the “Sakyan friends” in his verses at <a href="../tha/tha2.html#p154">Theragatha 2.18</a>, so it seems likely he was indeed the Sakyan Nandiya; perhaps he went forth later than his friends. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn31:3.1"><span class="parno">mn31:3.1</span>Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that park. The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This is one of several instances showing that the Buddha looked like an ordinary ascetic (see also <a href="../dn/dn2.html#dn2:10.8">DN2:11.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn140.html#mn140:5.9">MN140:5.11</a>).</span></span></span> and said to him, “Don’t come into this park, ascetic. There are three gentlemen staying here whose nature is to desire self-knowledge.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Attakāmarūpa</i> is glossed by the commentary as “those whose nature is to desire their own welfare”. In the Vinaya (<i lang="pi" translate="no">attakāma</i>) means to serve “one’s own desires” (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-ss4.html">Bu Ss 4</a>). But here it draws on Yājnavalkya’s description of one whose form is such that, having attained their only desire, the Self, they have become without desire (<i lang="pi" translate="no">ātmakāmam āptakāmam akāmaṁ rūpaṁ</i>, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.1.21, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.21. Cf. <i lang="pi" translate="no">niṣkāma āptakāma ātmakāmo</i>, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.7.2.8, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.6. In both cases the Bṛhadāraṇyaka reverses the sequence of <i lang="pi" translate="no">āpta</i> … <i lang="pi" translate="no">ātma</i>.) This describes a sage who is fully immersed in the realization of Brahman in death or dreamless sleep. Such realization is a form of “knowledge” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">veda</i>). Here the suffix <i lang="pi" translate="no">-rūpa</i> does not mean “seemingly”, nor is it to be discarded as a mere idiom, but has the sense given in the commentary, a person’s true form or true nature (<i lang="pi" translate="no">sabhāva</i>). This is, of course, not a Buddhist concept. But it is spoken by the keeper of a park (not a monastery) who fails to even recognize the Buddha. There is no reason he should be Buddhist. To this day, Buddhist monastics are received with kindness and unhesitatingly supported by Hindus, who readily interpret and describe the monastics’ practice in their own terms.</span></span></span> Do not disturb them.” </p>

<p id="mn31:4.1"><span class="parno">mn31:4.1</span>Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha, and said to him, “Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.” Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them, “Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:5.1"><span class="parno">mn31:5.1</span>Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha. One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet. The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, and washed his feet. Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:5.6"><span class="parno">mn31:5.6</span>The Buddha said to Anuruddha, “I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting almsfood.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text refers to “Anuruddhas” in plural. It was apparently the custom to refer to the group by their most senior member.</span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn31:5.8"><span class="parno">mn31:5.8</span>“We’re keeping well, Blessed One, we’re getting by. And we have no trouble getting almsfood.” </p>

<p id="mn31:6.1"><span class="parno">mn31:6.1</span>“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The emphasis on harmonious living fits the accounts in <a href="../vi/kd10.html#4.2.1">Kd 10:4.2.1</a> and <a href="../mn/mn128.html#content">MN128</a>, where the Buddha had just left the quarreling community of Kosambī. This suggests that the introduction belongs there, when the three friends were practicing together in the Eastern Bamboo Park near Kosambī. The current sutta is set around 400 kms to the east near Vesālī, and it is hardly likely that the Buddha went straight there after leaving Kosambī. In addition, in MN128 the three friends are still developing their meditation, whereas in the current sutta they have already achieved arahantship. It seems that the popular introduction of MN128 was reused to frame a later conversation with the three friends, despite the implausibility of the same events happening in the same way twice. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:6.2"><span class="parno">mn31:6.2</span>“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony like this.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:6.3"><span class="parno">mn31:6.3</span>“But how do you live this way?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:7.1"><span class="parno">mn31:7.1</span>“In this case, sir, I think, ‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate, to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’ I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These are three of the six “warm-hearted qualities” of <a href="../mn/mn48.html#5.4">MN48:6.2</a> and <a href="../an/an6.11.htm#content">AN6.11</a>.</span></span></span> I think, ‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’ And that’s what I do. Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:7.11"><span class="parno">mn31:7.11</span>And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added: </p>

<hr>

<p>“That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:8.1"><span class="parno">mn31:8.1</span>“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Normally I render <i lang="pi" translate="no">viharati</i> in such instances as “meditate”. But Anuruddha’s response avoids talking about meditation. I think he is deliberately avoiding the topic, skirting the obvious intended meaning by seizing on an ambiguity. His reticence echoes Yājñavalkya’s reticence to answer Janaka on the topic of a person’s light (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1). </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn31:9.1"><span class="parno">mn31:9.1</span>“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.” </p>

<p id="mn31:9.2"><span class="parno">mn31:9.2</span>“But how do you live this way?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:9.3"><span class="parno">mn31:9.3</span>“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from almsround prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin. If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures. Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory. If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up. If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lending each other a hand to lift. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For <i lang="pi" translate="no">hatthavilaṅghaka</i> (“lending a hand up”) see <a href="../mn/mn125.html#mn125:9.1">MN125:9.7</a>. <br>
The Chinese parallels (MA 128 at T i 729c9 and EA 24.8 at T ii 629a23) both add that they then retire for meditation. </span></span></span> And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">That is, three times in each <i lang="pi" translate="no">uposatha</i> period lasting a fortnight. <br> The Chinese parallels add that they might also sit in noble silence (in accord with <a href="../mn/mn26.html#mn26:4.9">MN26:4.10</a>). </span></span></span> That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here the Vinaya account ends, as it is concerned with the settlement of the quarrel among the monks of Kosambī. </span></span></span> </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:10.1"><span class="parno">mn31:10.1</span>“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation?” </p>

<p id="mn31:10.3"><span class="parno">mn31:10.3</span>“How could we not, sir? Whenever we want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, we enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The first absorption is defined at <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pj4.html#quality">Bhikkhu Pārājika 4</a> as the most basic “superhuman distinction”. Thus Anuruddha is answering the question directly but humbly, revealing as little as possible.</span></span></span> This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved while living diligent, keen, and resolute.” </p>

<p id="mn31:11-13.1"><span class="parno">mn31:11-13.1</span>“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Samatikkamāya</i> (“for going beyond”) is used in a similar sense at <a href="../mn/mn10.html#Samatikkamāya">MN10:47.1</a>.</span></span></span> </p>

This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.” </p>

<p id="mn31:14.1"><span class="parno">mn31:14.1</span>“Good, good! But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?” </p>

<p id="mn31:14.3"><span class="parno">mn31:14.3</span>“How could we not, sir? Whenever we want, with the fading away of rapture, we enter and remain in the third absorption, where we meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.” </p>

Whenever we want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, we enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, our defilements have come to an end. This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable meditation, that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.

<hr><a id="Dīgha"></a>

<p id="mn31:19.1"><span class="parno">mn31:19.1</span>Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<p id="mn31:20.1"><span class="parno">mn31:20.1</span>The venerables then accompanied the Buddha for a little way before turning back. Nandiya and Kimbila said to Anuruddha, “Did we ever tell you that we had gained such and such meditations and attainments, up to the ending of defilements, as you revealed to the Buddha?”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Even such close monks did not reveal their attainments to each other, a testament to their character. This is a reminder of the virtue of discretion when speaking of such subtle matters. They are not things to be bandied about in common conversation. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn31:20.4"><span class="parno">mn31:20.4</span>“The venerables did not tell me that they had gained such meditations and attainments. But I discovered it by comprehending your minds, and deities also told me. I answered when the Buddha directly asked about it.” </p>

<p id="mn31:21.1"><span class="parno">mn31:21.1</span>Then the native spirit Dīgha Parajana went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi" translate="no">Parajana</i> means “stranger” (Mil 6.3.1:13.2) or “strange spirit” (<a href="../mn/mn25.html#mn25:5.19">MN25:5.19</a>). The commentary identifies him with the Dīgha of <a href="../dn/dn32.html#dn32:10.14">DN32:10.18</a>. He must have been the deity of a local shrine. This passage shows how the intercession of even such a humble spirit can resound among all the gods. </span></span></span> “The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The praise that follows is unusually effusive and can be compared with the equally unusual recounting of the enlightened devotees of Ñātika (<a href="../dn/dn16.html#dn16:2.4.2">DN16:2.5.1</a>). Both passages serve to extol Buddhism in the home of Mahāvīra, the Buddha’s elder rival.</span></span></span> that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen, the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:21.5"><span class="parno">mn31:21.5</span>Hearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana, the earth gods raised the cry … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:21.9"><span class="parno">mn31:21.9</span>Hearing the cry of the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings … the gods of the thirty-three … the gods of Yama … the joyful gods … the gods who love to imagine … the gods who control what is imagined by others … the gods of the Divinity’s host raised the cry, “The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen, the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.” </p>

<p id="mn31:21.19"><span class="parno">mn31:21.19</span>And so at that moment, that second, that hour, those venerables were known as far as the realm of divinity. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:22.1"><span class="parno">mn31:22.1</span>“That’s so true, Dīgha! That’s so true! If the family from which those three gentlemen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for that family’s lasting welfare and happiness. If the family circle … village … town … city … country … all the aristocrats … all the brahmins … all the peasants … all the workers were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for all those menials’ lasting welfare and happiness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:22.12"><span class="parno">mn31:22.12</span>If the whole world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for the whole world’s lasting welfare and happiness. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:22.13"><span class="parno">mn31:22.13</span>See, Dīgha, how those three gentlemen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!” </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn31:22.14"><span class="parno">mn31:22.14</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the native spirit Dīgha Parajana approved what the Buddha said. </p>
