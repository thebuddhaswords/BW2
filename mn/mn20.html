<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p id="mn20:1.1"><span class="parno">mn20:1.1</span><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>

<p id="mn20:1.5"><span class="parno">mn20:1.5</span>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:2.1"><span class="parno">mn20:2.1</span>“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five subjects from time to time.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The “higher mind” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">adhicitta</i>) is the four <i lang="pi" translate="no">jhānas</i> (<a href="../an/an3.90.html#highermind">AN3.90</a>). <br>
“Subject” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">nimitta</i>) here has its normal meaning in meditation contexts: a property of experience that, when focused on, fosters similar properties. This is primarily the chosen subject of meditation, but it also includes any subject that the mind dwells on. <br>
“From time to time” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">kālena kālaṁ</i>): these are not fundamentals of meditation like mindfulness, which should always be developed, but rather expedients for dealing with specific problems when they arise. A meditator should be familiar with these methods and apply them when needed. However, one should not be over-eager to reach for these methods; they are meant for those times when the normal process of meditation has gone awry. </span></span></span> What five? </p>

<p id="mn20:3.1"><span class="parno">mn20:3.1</span>Take a mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. That mendicant should focus on some other subject connected with the skillful.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">For example, a meditator who finds themselves plagued with thoughts of annoyance, having recognized that this is happening per <a href="../mn/mn19.html#content">MN19</a>, should switch to a new meditation such as <i lang="pi" translate="no">mettā</i>. </span></span></span> As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. It’s like a deft mason or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg. In the same way, a mendicant … should focus on some other basis of meditation connected with the skillful … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:4.1"><span class="parno">mn20:4.1</span>Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other subject connected with the skillful, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts:<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">These methods are progressive; each one assumes that the former method has failed. <br>
Looking at the drawbacks of unskillful thoughts was the cornerstone of the Bodhisatta’s method at per <a href="../mn/mn19.html#mn19:2.1">MN19:3.4</a>.</span></span></span> ‘So these thoughts are unskillful, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Also as per <a href="../mn/mn19.html#mn19:2.1">MN19:3.4</a>.</span></span></span> As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. In the same way, a mendicant … should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:5.1"><span class="parno">mn20:5.1</span>Now, suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should try to forget and ignore them.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Forget” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">asati</i> and “ignore” is <i lang="pi" translate="no">amanasikāra</i>.</span></span></span> As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. Suppose there was a person with clear eyes, and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision. They’d just close their eyes or look away. In the same way, a mendicant … those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end …<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The repetitions here are dubious. The Mahāsaṅgīti edition here and following omits the method that stops the thoughts. It is surely implied, but in the absence of any witnesses, I translate to preserve the roughness of the Pali.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:6.1"><span class="parno">mn20:6.1</span>Now, suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The unique phrase “stopping the formation of thoughts” (<i lang="pi" translate="no">vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṁ</i>) lends the sutta its title. Here <i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhāra</i> refers to the energy that drives the formation of thoughts. Understanding the cause helps to deprive it of its power.</span></span></span> As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. Suppose there was a person walking quickly.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">“Walking quickly” like a person swamped by many thoughts (<a href="../mn/mn18.html#16.1">MN18:16.1</a>).</span></span></span> They’d think: ‘Why am I walking so quickly? Why don’t I slow down?’ So they’d slow down.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Multiple methods of quelling thought have failed, so this method focuses on gradually slowing down rather than stopping all at once. Asking “why am I thinking so much?” turns attention around, focusing on the previous thought rather than the next thing.</span></span></span> They’d think: ‘Why am I walking slowly? Why don’t I stand still?’ So they’d stand still. They’d think: ‘Why am I standing still? Why don’t I sit down?’ So they’d sit down. They’d think: ‘Why am I sitting? Why don’t I lie down?’ So they’d lie down. And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones. </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:6.22"><span class="parno">mn20:6.22</span>In the same way, a mendicant … those thoughts are given up and come to an end … </p>

<hr>

<p id="mn20:7.1"><span class="parno">mn20:7.1</span>Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As a last resort, the meditator forcibly crushes unwholesome thoughts and makes themselves think wholesome thoughts. This is one of the Jain-like mortifying meditations that the Bodhisatta undertook before discovering the middle way (<a href="../mn/mn36.html#mn36:19.10">MN36:20.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn85.html#mn85:19.10">MN85:20.1</a>, <a href="../mn/mn100.html#mn100:16.10">MN100:17.1</a>). There, compared to the other practices such as meditating without breathing, it is the first and gentlest. Thus the most gentle of the mortifying meditations becomes the harshest of the Buddhist methods. <br>
The first two terms (<i lang="pi" translate="no">abhiniggaṇhāti</i>, <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhinippīḷeti</i>) also occur in the context of defeating an opponent in debate (<a href="../an/an10.116.html#abhiniggaṇhāti">AN10.116</a>) and sexual assault (<a href="../vi/bu-vb-ss2.html#abhiniggaṇhāti">Bhikkhu Saṅghadisesa 2</a>). <i lang="pi" translate="no">Abhisantāpeti</i> does not occur elsewhere in early Pali, but at Atharvaveda 2.12.6c it is a divine punishment for heretics.</span></span></span> As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. It’s like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them. In the same way, a mendicant … with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, should squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. </p>

<p id="mn20:8.1"><span class="parno">mn20:8.1</span>Now, take the mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. They focus on some other subject connected with the skillful … They examine the drawbacks of those thoughts … They try to forget and ignore about those thoughts … They focus on stopping the formation of thoughts … With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, they squeeze, squash, and crush mind with mind. When they succeed in each of these things, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thought. They will think what they want to think, and they won’t think what they don’t want to think. They’ve cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">This sentence has a number of dubious features. Up until now the Chinese parallel at MA 101 is fairly similar, but it lacks this phrase. In addition, the passage lacks the expected conditional <i lang="pi" translate="no">yato ca</i> construction (“When a mendicant … then they are called one who has cut off craving …”, eg. <a href="../mn/mn22.1.html#content">MN22.1</a>). Moreover, being phrased in the past tense it sits uneasily with the future tense of the previous phrase, and would have made better sense reversed (“Having cut off craving … they will think what they want to think”). Taken together, these considerations suggest that this passage may have been inserted by error in the Pali. The original scope of the sutta, then, would have focused solely on the quieting of thoughts for attaining <i lang="pi" translate="no">samādhi</i>. </span></span></span> </p>

<p id="mn20:8.14"><span class="parno">mn20:8.14</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>
